This is the place to talk about US stocks, right? May I ask what do you think of the US stocks tonight? It would be even better if we could talk about the Hong Kong stock market tomorrow. What I care about is the Dow and the Hang Seng Index. Big, but Friday is the window of time, and at the same time, the unemployment report will also be announced, and it is very likely to reverse the trend, so it is worth noting the market on Friday.
