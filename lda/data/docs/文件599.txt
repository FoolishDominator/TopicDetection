SKY: ESWC League How can I trust you ESWC World Finals will be held at Disneyland Paris, France from June 30th to July 4th, 2010. Today, the ESWC official website announced the competition rules of some projects. Among them, the World of Warcraft competition rules are: 1. Contestants must be 16 years old on June 30, 2010. 2. 15 days before the finals, if there is a new patch, use the latest version of the game. If a patch is released within 15 days before the final, the organizing committee decides whether to use the latest version. I really can't believe that ESWC can continue, but I really saw the news. Thinking of ESWC in 2008, I went to Paris to play the qualifying match alone because of the defeat in the Chinese division. Then I went to the United States with Chinese TEAM to participate in the World Finals, and I almost paid for the ESWC ticket in full at that time. What's more, the prize money from the qualifying competition to the world finals has not even gotten a penny. But just like that, ESWC was held again after a year of silence. I feel like I have to write here as well, so far I have not won the ESWC Paris Invitational, the prize money from the World Finals in the United States, nor have anyone contacted me before or now at ESWC. I think the same should be true of WHO and TED. So I hope you all take precautions while playing the game. At the same time, I also hope that all professional e-sports players can remind them to protect their rights and interests no matter what competition they are in!
