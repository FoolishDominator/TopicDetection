(2009-03-23 13:32:56) Expert [Zeng Wenjun] Answer: Gold stocks have risen very much recently, but such strong stocks generally have oscillating heads, so they still maintain such a strong situation.

Thank you (2009-03-23 13:38:11) Expert [Zeng Wenjun] Answer: Gold is still oscillating before breaking through $1,000, so be cautious. If it weren't for the big depreciation of the dollar, gold?

(2009-03-23 13:40:44) Expert [Zeng Wenjun] Answer: Since the last time I was optimistic about copper, the price of copper in the past two weeks is indeed very satisfactory. It has broken through the platform and rose from $3,600 to today's highest of $4,100. Dollar. FCX also rose from 30 to 39. I think that in the current good situation, we can continue to hold, and have not seen any major adverse factors, even if there is a normal correction, it is acceptable. (2009-03-23 13:40:44) Netizen [Anonymous] asked: Teacher, which sector are you optimistic about in US stocks recently? (2009-03-23 13:43:15) Expert [Zeng Wenjun] A: The resource category.

Please help me analyze in detail today that the market has broken through 2300 points, whether there is still room for a rebound in the market outlook, and please help me analyze 600489, 600997, thank you! !!!!!(2009-03-23 16:06:53) Expert [Zeng Wenjun] Answer: After the last sitting, A-shares first retraced to 2100 points. Afterwards, US stocks strengthened, coupled with the surge in resources, and now they continue to announce details of revitalization, and even rumors of a new stimulus plan. I think the broader market should continue to oscillate upwards. The recent gains in gold and coal stocks have been very large. When the stock index is close to the 2400 area, there may be a big oscillation. In the short term, you can consider gradually reducing your positions, and you can still intervene after the correction (2009-03-23 16:06:53) Netizen [Anonymous] ] Question: Hello, Mr. Zeng, I see you again.

Now in the US financial stocks, if you were yourself, which one would you choose and how to operate? Thanks, just for reference, don't worry. Also, can you roughly estimate when the negative effects of the April earnings report will start to appear? Will it be lower than in February (2009-03-23 20:00:21) Expert [Zeng Wenjun] A: I will not choose financial stocks for the time being. The big rally in financial stocks I think is a normal reflection of the end of bankruptcy fears. And stocks at such low prices can be very volatile. Today, the details of the handling of toxic assets were announced again, which is another strong stimulus for financial stocks. I will not pursue them. After all, business problems are still very serious. (2009-03-23 20:00:21) Netizen [anonymous] asked: Mr. Zeng, I finally expected you to come, but I’m so sorry to ask for help.

You can help analyze the recent trend of the stock and how to do it. Thank you! (2009-03-23 21:25:36) Expert [Zeng Wenjun] A: The copying of the SME board has passed. This wave is the performance of resources. Of course, as long as the broader market is still up, the stock should still have room to rise. Just note that once the broader market weakens, non-mainstream breeds will be hurt the most. If this wave of the broader market is coming to an end, it is recommended to be out of the market, and the stock cannot be held for a long time. It's okay for now. (2009-03-23 21:25:36) Netizen [Anonymous] asked: Hello teacher: I finally waited for you to sit in the hall, huh, I like you very much! Can you help me analyze 000952 and 600837, thank you!

In the early stage, the Baotou Steel that you let me hold all the time really made a lot of money. Still remember me? Now I switch to Leshan Electric Power! The cost of 8.30 has risen quite well in the past two days. Do you think I should hold or sell high? where? Where is the support level? thank you! The one who has been waiting for you. (2009-03-23 21:32:45) Expert [Zeng Wenjun] A: I remember that. Leshan Power is a follow-up, or it is better to sell high. The pressure above is at 9 blocks and the support is at 7.7. Unlike Baotou Steel, the stock cannot be held for a long time. (2009-03-23 21:32:45) Netizen [Anonymous] asked: Hello, Mr. Zeng, is it feasible for me to sell 601168 for a short-term exchange today for 600333? Basically, I don’t believe that he will lose 100 million in 2009. Evil, where is the 333 resistance? Thank you, handsome guy for the analysis (2009-03-23 21:36:32) Expert [Zeng Wenjun] Answer: It is completely feasible. The short-term gains in the non-ferrous category have been too large. 600333 was an active stock in the past. Under the good situation of the broader market, it is expected to start a better short-term compensating market. Resistance is around 6.5.
