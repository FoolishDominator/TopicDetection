To be honest, neither team scored high, but the Bayi Shuanglu team performed worse than the Beijing team, so the Beijing team won. Now that the Beijing team has won five consecutive games, it is a very good start. I hope they will not make the mistakes of our game and can treat the results of these games with a normal heart.

A Dijiang: The Beijing team seized the opportunity in a stalemate. The Bayi Shuanglu team also had a chance, but they didn't score what they should have scored. Especially when we overtaken the game, there were some loopholes in the defense, and the Beijing team caught it in time. Take the opportunity, the Beijing team is relatively reasonable to seize the opportunity. Q: The first three quarters were all a draw. Letâ€™s talk about the fourth quarter. The Bayi Shuanglu team seemed to make a lot of mistakes and the hit rate was very low. A Dijiang: Today is the lowest score of the Bayi Shuanglu team since the start of the game, but this is the second time we lost to the double foreign aid in the fourth quarter. In fact, we have made progress and improved in the fourth quarter against the double foreign aid. Some players, like Da Zhi, are in ups and downs. The game is too tight, and it is impossible to force all players to perform well in every game. I hope they will gradually recover and combine playing and tuning. Today's hit rate is not his normal hit rate, it is very poor. This has something to do with his participation in two major competitions this year and his involvement in the league after the Asian Games, so he must adjust in time. In fact, our problem today is the hit rate. This kind of game is also rare. All three quarters are tied. It can be seen that the two teams presented a wonderful game to the fans on Christmas Eve. Xu Zhonghao, a member of the Bayi Shuanglu team, said, "All of our players want to play this game well, and they do put some burdens on themselves. There will be more games to come, so let's start again with our feet on the ground." (Little San Son)
