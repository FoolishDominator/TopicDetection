Kobe Bryant is getting more and more perfect, and if the Lakers continue their current path (5-0), they will end the regular season with an 82-0 record. 2. Chris Paul, Hornets, last week's ranking: none If the Lakers don't complete their 82-0 feat, it's possible if the Hornets can beat their opponents to a 5-game winning streak on Saturday's road game against the Heat Unbeaten season.

Dirk Nowitzki, Mavericks, last week's ranking: 5 Like Chris Paul, Monta Ellis and Pau Gasol, Nowitzki ranks in the league in four of the numbers the top twenty. In the first two games of the regular season, he made 22 of 28 attempts and shot 60.3 percent from the field. 5. Monta Ellis, Warriors, last week's ranking: Ellis's form was still up and down, he scored 46 points in the first game against the Rockets, and then dropped to 15 points in the second game.

In an average of 27 points per game, he can get 20 points, 11 rebounds and 4 blocks, can be called excellent. But according to his current performance, Howard will be a club with 1,000 rebounds and 100 blocks in a single season because of the lack of about 100 rebounds. And for the past five seasons, he's been in it. 8. Pau Gasol, Lakers, last week's ranking: None Gasol was eighth in player efficiency last season, and he's sixth so far this season. In five games, he did not score less than 21 points in a single game and grabbed at least 11 rebounds in each of four games.

Three of Kidd's first four games had more than 10 assists. 10. Lamar Odom, Lakers, last week's ranking: None. Nowitzki's shooting percentage is horrible, but Odom is better than him. The Lakers made 50 shots in the first five games, hitting 35 shots, and shooting 70 percent from the field. That was the best 43-for-60 shooting since Charles Barkley's first five regular-season games in 1991-92. One thing that needs to be mentioned is that Odom made 10 of his 50 3-pointers, and he hit 8 of them. (Wolfman)
