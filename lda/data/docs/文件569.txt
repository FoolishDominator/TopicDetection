The highlight of Group C of the WCG Finals, Grubby easily won the match between Grubby and Who, which was supposed to be a contest between the closest big names today, but this match did not appear the stalemate that people expected before the match. In the early game, Who seemed to be a little out of shape, allowing Grubby to grab shoes and fans at the same time, and fell into a passive state. Later, when Grubby Juggernaut slashed his anemic big G, Who chose to secretly train Blue Fatty, but his anemic big G did not run in the opposite direction, which caused Grubby to kill Big G. After Grubby killed Big G, he returned the experience and treasure of Lan Fatty with a carbine. All in the bag, Juggernaut reached level 3 early. There was not much suspense in the subsequent games. With the harassment of the Level 3 Juggernaut, it was difficult for Who's SH to level up easily, and his Level 2 Juggernaut was embarrassedly slaughtered in the process of accompanying MF. After the Shadow Hunter reached 3, Grubby launched a total attack. Although Who was playing at home, and the hard workers joined the battle at the first time, the huge advantage in the early stage still allowed Grubby to win easily. Grubby qualified first in the group.
