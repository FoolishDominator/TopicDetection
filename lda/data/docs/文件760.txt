In addition to reading your blog, I am looking forward to seeing you soon. I would like to ask your opinion on real estate stocks. Yunnan Urban Investment is very dynamic. I would like to ask you to see if this stock has the possibility of re-testing the previous high point? thanks. (2009-09-07 19:12:54) Expert [Zeng Wenjun] A: It is too reluctant to say whether it can reach the previous high point. The current price is also a pressure. Real estate stocks are facing fundamental pressure, so be careful. (2009-09-07 19:12:54) Netizen [mobile phone user] asked: Teacher! You are finally here, I miss you so much!

It is not recommended to hold the stock for the long term. The U.S. stock market is closed today, and Sina has made no arrangements. However, to answer the questions of the previous friends, see my blog for the analysis of the general trend of A shares. (2009-09-07 20:59:09) Netizen [Anonymous] asked: Hello Wen Jun, from my personal point of view, the US stock market has been rising for 6 months, and the fourth quarter and next spring should be adjusted. The cycle of each year is generally like this, and this year I have caught up with the last loan, so I wonder if I can hold the currency? What's your suggestion? Or suggest some defensive type stocks? Thank you, I am a rude man, I am wrong, please correct me (2009-09-07 21:40:13) Expert [Zeng Wenjun] Answer: Now the US stock market as a whole is stuck in a sideways, or almost all varieties are large sideways. So I suggest waiting for a clear trend to come out. Whether or not holding shares is related to each person's affordability cannot be generalized. (2009-09-07 21:40:13) Netizen [anonymous] asked: Zeng Shuai, I have been reading your blog, you said that tomorrow the short-term break of 2800 will be cleared, and I plan to smoke some liquor stocks tomorrow if I get to near 2750, In addition, I hold 20% of gold stocks. May I ask the teacher's opinion (2009-09-07 21:42:31) Expert [Zeng Wenjun] Answer: Everyone has their own operating habits and styles. What I'm talking about is that if 2800 breaks, take the previous profit first. Then look at the situation. Your operation depends on your personal risk tolerance and profit expectations. Willing to profit or avoid risk when trading sideways. (2009-09-07 21:42:31) Netizen [anonymous] asked: Hello teacher, please help analyze 600050 Unicom, I have set 15% now, I want to cut it for gold, is it worth it? Thank you (2009-09-07 21:46:23) Expert [Zeng Wenjun] A: It's not worth it. It is not recommended to switch. Leave for a while, I won't be back too much today. (2009-09-07 21:46:23
