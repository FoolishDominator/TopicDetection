U.S. Embassy: Fees for applying for a U.S. visa Visa fees Most non-diplomatic visas and non-official visas issued by U.S. embassies and consulates abroad require applicants to pay a visa application fee to cover the cost of visa production, processing and printing. The current U.S. nonimmigrant visa application fee is $131. All applicants for non-immigrant visas in China must pay an application fee of RMB 904 (from July 24, 2008) at the designated China CITIC Bank. This fee is non-refundable. The two-part application fee receipt issued by China CITIC Bank should be submitted together with other visa application materials. Please note: Visa application fees are non-refundable regardless of visa issuance. Those who have paid the visa application fee and have not lodged their visa application within one year will also not be able to get a refund. Only applicants with diplomatic passports, applicants eligible for A, G, C-2, C-3, NATO visas, and J visa applicants sponsored by the U.S. government are exempt from the visa application fee. In addition to the visa application fee, there is a visa issuance fee for certain categories of visas. The visa issuance fee is charged on a reciprocal basis (another country also charges a fee when a U.S. citizen obtains a visa of a similar category). The United States has been fighting to eliminate visa issuance fees as much as possible. However, when a foreign government charges U.S. citizens a visa issuance fee for a certain class of visas, the U.S. will charge citizens of that country the same amount for a similar class of visas. The visa issuance fee should be paid in U.S. dollars or local currency at the U.S. embassy or consulate after the visa is approved. Chinese citizens are currently only required to pay the visa issuance fee when applying for an L-type visa.
