What you must know: The Origins of American State Names (Photos) Toponymy or Toponymy belongs to the category of historical linguistics. Historical linguists have done considerable research on the origin of place names. The U.S. Department of the Interior once brought together a group of capable linguists and set up a specialized agency whose task is to study the origin of place names in the United States and give accurate explanations. More than half of the place names in the United States are of Indian origin. The rest originated in Europe, such as commemorating emperors and queens, or a special area, as well as commemorating important historical figures and recording historical activities.
