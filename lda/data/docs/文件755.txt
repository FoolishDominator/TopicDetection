On August 20th, U.S. stock market experts sat in the hall. On August 20th, U.S. stock market expert Zeng Wenjun visited Sina Finance and answered the questions raised by Sina netizens about the stock market. I would like to ask if it is confirmed that the economy has recovered, after this major adjustment, can coal stocks be used as a long-term investment after the bottom area comes out. If so, which one is Datong Coal, Xishan Coal and Electricity, or Guoyang Xinneng is the most worthy of long-term investment? Please advise! (2009-08-20 12:52:43) Expert [Zeng Wenjun] Answer: I am cautious about the performance of resource stocks in the next few months. The previous performance of resource stocks was coupled with strong inflation expectations. This support factor may be weakened in the follow-up. (2009-08-20 12:52:43) Netizen [Anonymous] asked: Mr. Zeng, I don't understand that the bull market in 2007 saw the biggest rise in coal stocks. Since the global economy is showing signs of bottoming out, why do you think you are not optimistic about resources now? For example, do you think Panjiang shares have long-term investment value? (2009-08-20 16:52:28) Expert [Zeng Wenjun] Answer: As mentioned earlier, there are two supporting factors for resource stocks, one is economic recovery Two of the earliest recovering industries at the beginning of the cycle are strong inflation expectations. Both factors will weaken as the recovery progresses. The bull market in 2007 has entered the end of economic growth. Overheated investment has created a strong demand for upstream resources. (2009-08-20 16:52:28) Netizen [Anonymous] asked: Mr. Zeng's analysis is too pragmatic, appreciate it! Do you think AIG is worth investing in from the perspective of risk-reward ratio? It feels like another C. In addition, is NYX good for growth within 3 years? (2009-08-20 17:23:15) Expert [Zeng Wenjun] A: It is worth participating. NYX will definitely perform in sync with the rise of the market. Growth is difficult to say, after all, it is already such a large exchange, and it is impossible to have the same high growth as a small business. (2009-08-20 17:23:15) Netizen [Anonymous] asked: Mr. Zeng, good evening! I read your comments every day, and the benefits are not shallow. Have the A shares bottomed out? Is there still room for 600,675 Chinese companies to fall? After reading your blog, is it possible to replenish the position? Please don't miss me, thanks! (2009-08-20 19:53:09) Expert [Zeng Wenjun] A: It is not recommended to cover positions on this stock. If it rebounds to 16.8, it is better to wait and see first. (2009-08-20 19:53:09) Netizen [Anonymous] asked: Hello teacher, 600978 I cost 7.05, I have been quilted, may I ask how to go in the later stage, whether to leave or stay, thank you (2009-08- 20 20:27:38) Expert [Zeng Wenjun] A: Yihua Wood is an export industry, and the economic recovery in the United States is beneficial to the company's performance. As long as the broader market stabilizes, the stock's later trend is still worth looking forward to. Whether to go or stay depends on the market trend and your own risk tolerance. (2009-08-20 20:27:38) Netizen [anonymous] asked: Mr. Wenjun, hello! I consulted about 600589 a few days ago. I made up all the positions in the early trading today. I would like to ask the teacher, do you think this wave of rebound 7.6--7.7 can be achieved? And what do you think is the probability of the broader market falling below the half-year line again? Thank you for your busy answer. (2009-08-20 20:29:34) Expert [Zeng Wenjun] A: If it is just a rebound, it is estimated that it will not be reached. 7.5 is a great pressure. If the half-year line is the bottom of this wave of decline, it doesn't matter. The probability of falling below the half-year line again is now 1.5 and 1.5. (2009-08-20 20:29:34) Netizen [Anonymous] asked: Hello, Mr. Zeng! Everyone likes you to sit in the hall, and there are many people. Is it appropriate to buy a small amount of 000939 at the end of the day today? What price to restock? Where is the short-term pressure level? Thank you very much! (2009-08-20 20:50:56) Expert [Zeng Wenjun] A: The short-term pressure is at 9.5, and the issue of adding positions is not considered at present. Instead, be wary of the risk of another fall. (2009-08-20 20:50:56) Netizen [Anonymous] asked: Mr. Zeng, what do you think of the WH stock? Is it worth intervening? (2009-08-20 21:08:07) Expert [Zeng Wenjun] Answer: I'm not too sure about the company, the results announcement has dropped a lot, so it is recommended to wait and see. (2009-08-20 21:08:07) Netizen [anonymous] asked: Hello teacher! You have worked hard! Thank you for your warm service to us! May I ask you to sign a new share of 002280 New Century 500 shares, which will open tomorrow, how to operate? thank you! (2009-08-20 21:21:54) Expert [Zeng Wenjun] A: This question depends on your choice, whether you want to earn the price difference of the new stock directly, or you want to make money through the trading of this stock. (2009-08-20 21:21:54) Netizen [anonymous] asked: STP or YGE which one is better? thanks. (2009-08-20 21:24:27) Expert [Zeng Wenjun] A: There is no essential difference, we can still care about the industry. (2009-08-20 21:24:27) Netizen [Anonymous] asked: Hello teacher! You have worked hard! Best regards to you! May I ask 600170 Shanghai Construction Engineering: I bought it at 14.1 yuan today, what price will it be sold at tomorrow? thank you! (2009-08-20 21:24:50) Expert [Zeng Wenjun] A: For short-term operation, about 15 yuan can be considered. (2009-08-20 21:24:50) Netizen [anonymous] asked: Mr. Zeng, hello! What is the trend of DXO and USO? How is oil doing? thanks. (2009-08-20 21:24:56) Expert [Zeng Wenjun] A: The oil price is now oscillating around the previous high of 72. Whether it can successfully hit a new high is what we need to wait for the market to confirm. Don't make predictions right now. (2009-08-20 21:24:56)
