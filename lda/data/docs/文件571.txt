In the finals, 2 people from FIFA China advanced to the top 16 and 1 person eliminated the WCG2009 World Finals on the first day of the FIFA project AD group. Chinese players Cookie and Zola both qualified for the second group. Zola's group B has one of the famous German FIFA twins. SK_styla, SK_styla finally made it to the top of the group. The Korean players kaka and zola had the same score and were eliminated due to the outcome. Cookie also eliminated a Korean player to advance to the top 16. Another Chinese player, Timmy, was unfortunately eliminated in third place in Group C, and another German player, SK_hero, won the first qualifying group in Group D. It seems that the twin brothers are likely to complete the first three WCG championships in China. Tomorrow will be the EH group stage, the highlight of which is Ukraine's PinCho_Yozhyk, who is also the twin brothers' biggest opponent.
