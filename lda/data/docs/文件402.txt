Reminder of studying abroad: The Ministry of Education issued an early warning for studying in Belgium. In response to the recent incidents of Chinese students studying in Belgium being rejected by the Belgian customs when entering the country or being asked to leave the country by the Belgian police when applying for an identity certificate, the Ministry of Education reminded students studying in Belgium on the 23rd to pay attention. Strictly abide by the relevant regulations. According to the reporter's understanding, the main reason for the above problems is that some overseas students failed to report at the time specified in the admission notice of the university or language training center, and were detained by the customs when entering the country. Once the school replied that they would not register, they were refused entry. Some overseas students listen to information or rumors posted on the Internet, spend money to buy so-called "legal" economic guarantees, and apply for identity certificates; some even use fake economic guarantees to apply for identity certificates. Departure by deadline. In order to prevent similar incidents from happening again, the Ministry of Education reminds students studying in Belgian universities or language training centers to strictly abide by the relevant regulations in Belgium and to report to the school according to the notified enrollment date. In case of any delay, please contact the school in advance and get approval. In addition, don't trust the information posted on the Internet or by others that can "provide legal economic guarantee or legal identity certificate for a fee", so as to avoid unnecessary losses.
