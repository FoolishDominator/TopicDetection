Foreign travel anecdote: Americans like to pretend to be from somewhere The difference between the American accent and the British and Australian accents makes it impossible to distinguish the subtle differences in intonation with Canadians, so it is mistaken for Canadians to speak the same tone as Americans. At the train station in Ventimiglia, a small Italian town, I asked the girl who was sitting next to me where she was from, and she probably forgot the Canadian flag on her backpack, and answered without thinking: "DC from America" - Washington, D.C., But when she left, she got up and found the Canadian flag hanging on her backpack... In many countries including Asia, Vietnam, Thailand, Japan, and many European countries, I have seen North Americans with Canadian flags hanging or sewing on their backpacks. At first, it was not clear why Canada, a small country with a small population, could see her citizens everywhere, but on the contrary, it was difficult to meet the travelers of the populous country with the American flag - the United States.
