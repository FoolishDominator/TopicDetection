Swedish entrepreneur transforms Boeing 747 into hotel It is usually sold for scrap or sent to the desert to fend for itself. But Swedish entrepreneur Oscar Dios has come up with a good idea - converting a 30-year-old battered plane he bought into a hotel. Dios put 85 beds in a gigantic Boeing 747, which he named the Jumbo Hostel, and parked on the right outside Arlanda Airport in Stockholm. It has 25 rooms and the best ones are on the upper floors of the plane. But if you want to spend a romantic evening with someone (or someone you just picked up), you'll love the plush cockpit suite. It's more spacious, has a separate bathroom, and gives you sweeping views of the airport runway.
