On March 17th, the US stock market expert Warren Wang visited Sina Finance and answered the questions raised by Sina netizens about the stock market. The recent trend of A shares is different from the prediction in your blog. After the continuous shrinking and small decline, the heavy volume rose sharply today. From a technical point of view, can you analyze the reasons for the previous shrinking and yin decline and today's large increase in heavy volume? Will the A-share market get stronger and stronger? thanks. (2009-03-17 19:57:45) Expert [King Warren] A: Yes, the trend is good on Tuesday, and the weak pattern may change in the short term, but to rise sharply, it still needs to break through the important resistance of 2200 and 2400.
