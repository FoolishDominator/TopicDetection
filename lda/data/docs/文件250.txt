Australian lottery preliminary interpretation: Tottenham can be brave Blackburn to rebound under the broader market As the Champions League ignites the war in the middle of the week, the European arena has once again become the focus of everyone's attention, and this weekend's winning lottery guessing will also heat up. Judging from the matchup situation, Liverpool should be the number one choice in this quiz. The current Red Army is in good shape, and it is one of the only two undefeated teams in the league. Aocai opened the initial market of Qiu and a half/two goals for it, which is basically a must-have market for the Red Army. In the previous 13 games of Qiu and a half/two goals, Liverpool won 10 and 3 A draw, with a winning percentage of more than 75 percent. In addition to Liverpool, Tottenham's winning percentage is not small. Aocai opened a preliminary game for Tottenham's game. Based on Tottenham's recent performance in the league, the preliminary game was obviously too deep. The purpose of the dealer's deep opening of the preliminary game was to force the chips to go to the next game. There is also the game of Blackburn with the same lure. Since Mark Hughes left, Blackburn has left a group of leaders without a leader, and with the start of the new season, Blackburn's continuous losing trend has made players sneer at them. From a gaming point of view , the current Rangers are at a low ebb, and Fulham has changed the image of last year's relegation at the beginning of this season. Although they have played a round less, today's tenant farmers still squeezed in with a record of 3 games and 2 wins. The top six places in the Premier League, especially after the defeat of Arsenal, the attention of the tenant farmers has skyrocketed. In the last round, they were still able to beat Bolton and win the game despite the heat, which further enhanced players' interest in their betting.
