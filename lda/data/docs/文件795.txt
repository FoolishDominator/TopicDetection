(2009-12-04 22:02:46) Expert [Zeng Wenjun] A: The good news of employment figures led to a rise in the US dollar and a setback for the gold price. If the Fed will consider raising interest rates, then the gold issue needs to be treated carefully. Gold's short-term support is 1160, but if you are doing margin gold, this range may be too large, so you need to pay attention to the rebound to around 1200.

(2009-12-04 22:15:45) Anonymous asked: About half an hour ago, the US dollar index and the Dow futures started at the same time, and the trend was exactly the same, so strange! Can you explain, Mr. Zeng? (2009-12-04 21:59:41) Expert [Zeng Wenjun] A: The number of unemployed fell below 10%, and the market began to think that the Fed would consider raising interest rates. Unemployment improvement means that the economy is improving and the stock market is good, and the interest rate hike means that the dollar may appreciate. This is the reason for both. In the past two months, US stocks have been driven by inflation expectations, forming a negative correlation between the US dollar and the Dow. (2009-12-04 22:05:51) Anonymous asked: Hello, Mr. Zeng, I bought Yunhai Metal 002182 at 17 yuan, and I have done the elevator several times. Can I hold it? The dollar is weak, why are non-ferrous metals gone? Not a good market (2009-12-04 21:54:21) Expert [Zeng Wenjun] A: The influence of individual stocks is a lot. For example, if Shandong gold goes up, CICC will not. Non-ferrous stocks do not rise also has his factors. But if the commodity continues to be strong, there is reason to believe that it will eventually follow suit. This is an operational idea, not a necessary relationship. (2009-12-04 22:03:31) Anonymous asked: Hello Mr. Zeng, I am a loyal follower of your blog, but I have been a little confused recently. I hope you can clear it up: After the market fell sharply last Friday, what do you think Central banks acted to make the dollar's depreciation not necessarily sustainable, then advised "investors to dump their assets, including stocks, commodities and gold, and wait for further clarity on the situation. We have been long on gold, commodities and equity indices since mid-October. The operation suggestion is over." But then the market came out of a wave of market conditions, how should I look back on this incident now, is the incident clear? Do you think the dollar will continue to depreciate? (2009-12-04 21:54:03) Expert [Zeng Wenjun] A: The cycle you see is too short to compare a two-month cycle with a few-day cycle. My judgment is that the unilateral depreciation process has ended, and it has entered a pattern of large oscillations. The current fundamental factors no longer support the unilateral decline of the dollar, but it does not mean that the unilateral rise will start immediately. (2009-12-04 22:00:24) Anonymous asked: The short position immediately exploded, why did the Dow soar? Is it a good time to go short tonight? Thank you (2009-12-04 21:43:46) Expert [Zeng Wenjun] A: The unemployment figure has fallen below 10%. Shorting U.S. stocks is not a short-term move, but a plan. As I said yesterday, be prepared to go short with a stop loss of 11,000. Take 1500 pips of profit with a possible loss of 500 pips.

Thank you (2009-12-04 21:40:55) Expert [Zeng Wenjun] Answer: The largest independent power supplier in the United States, it should not be a problem to hold it. However, it is recommended to think about how to operate when buying, short-term or long-term. Don't try to make a long-term move just because you lose money. The trend is still weak, and the intervention points are lacking. Hope that the broader market can continue to rise, you can also look forward to unwinding. The bottom is supported at 12 blocks. (2009-12-04 21:51:12) Anonymous asked: Brother Zeng, how about mgm? (2009-12-04 21:36:09) Expert [Zeng Wenjun] A: The trend is weak, with a small support of 10 yuan. When the market remains strong, it can be an entry point. Otherwise, participate with caution. (2009-12-04 21:46:03) Anonymous asked: Is the teacher optimistic about AAPL? Many agencies have recommended it recently, thank you! ! ! (2009-12-04 21:34:55) Expert [Zeng Wenjun] A: AAPL has analyzed it two days ago, and now the market competition is becoming more and more fierce, and it is no longer the only one it used to be.

(2009-12-04 21:31:04) Expert [Zeng Wenjun] A: The previous China Merchants Bank and petrochemicals all belong to large-cap stocks. Today's strong performance of large-cap stocks, and how to develop in the future, still needs to be observed. Of course, we look forward to completing the style switch and getting out of a big market. This cannot be decided by us, but the market will come out. A day's heavy volume doesn't have a direct impact on large-cap stocks. (2009-12-04 21:41:38) Anonymous question: Great teacher Xiao Zeng: I came here tonight to report to you: half of Shandong Gold and half of Kailuan. When will it be out, please tell me on the blog! wish you healthy! Happy family! Business is prosperous! May all go well with you!

Whether it helps or not is up to you. (2009-12-04 21:38:00) Anonymous asked: If you are short on gold, it will go up. You watch too much and he falls. You are bearish on finance, he is up. Wait until you suggest intervening. The market is about to call back. (2009-12-04 21:22:07) Expert [Zeng Wenjun] Answer: ? ? I have been bullish on gold since it passed 1,000 in September. It was only after the expected target of 1,200 fell sharply last Friday that I suggested everyone to get out of the market and avoid it. As for finance, I have made it clear in the auditorium that it is temporarily weak, but I do not know when the collective surge will suddenly erupt. If you are not satisfied with this, there is no way I can do better. (2009-12-04 21:32:31) Anonymous asked: Handsome guy Zeng, I bought some stocks such as bac, aig, ung, lyg, etc. Now I want to ask a strategic question, I am currently losing 20%, I want to do long-term , No problem for 2 years, do you think I am good at cutting meat or worth holding for a long time? (2009-12-04 21:16:09) Expert [Zeng Wenjun] Answer: If you want to do it for 2 years, you can hold it. It's just that if the market adjusts, you may also face a floating loss of 50%. Buffett bought Goldman Sachs at 115, and it fell to over 60. Depends on your own opinion. (2009-12-04 21:29:37) Anonymous asked: Hello Mr. Zeng: Please take a look at the late trend of the 600960 Binzhou Pistons, thank you! (2009-12-04 20:42:24) Expert [Zeng Wenjun] A: Yesterday's trading volume increased too much, and today it is adjusted to the support of 10 yuan. Strong stocks will have the opportunity to go up and down repeatedly. Then we'll have to look at the big board.

Now 8 blocks are a support, but as long as the market is slightly adjusted, the support will probably be broken, and the stronger support below is 6 blocks. (2009-12-04 21:24:41)
