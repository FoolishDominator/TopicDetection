Gamer's Car: Xbox 360 Concept Car A gamer, Patrick Wyrick, assisted Suzuki Motors in building an Xbox 360 concept car. Based on the Suzuki SX4, the car promises both performance and Xbox 360 entertainment. Looking at the photo, there is a 360 handle in the center of the steering wheel, and the other is in front of the gear lever. In addition, from the description of the picture, we know that this car has two XBOX 360, two projectors, and two screens, one of which is a 360. Installed on the center console. The audio and video part of this car includes multi-channel audio, and the Xbox controller is perfectly integrated with the car dashboard. A hood made of recycled materials acts as a screen. There is also an Xbox 360 in the middle of the rear seat, which is connected to the two monitors fixed above the front seats, which can be used for Internet access and entertainment. There is even a 30-inch screen of recyclable material hidden in the cargo box behind the car. When everyone feels that "single music is not as good as everyone's music", you can transfer the position to the rear of the car and "fight" on the spot. To make it even more realistic, the seats also feature a force feedback system and four wireless controllers, one of which is right on the steering wheel! I still want to remind everyone to concentrate on driving when driving, and never get distracted or confuse the game with the real world.
