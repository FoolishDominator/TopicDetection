People who have studied abroad: the strange phenomenon of studying in the United States Some strange phenomena had to be summed up. Before I came to the United States, I never worried about being fat, and the word never entered my dictionary. But when I came to the United States, eating was not because of physical needs, but because of the need of emptiness in my heart, and the feeling of home no longer existed. Weight is improving day by day. When I came to the United States, let's not talk about the legend of not getting fat. Girls will only ask, how much more do you have? I really hope I can control it, but it's really so difficult. But returning to China is definitely a good choice to lose weight. 10 kilograms used to be an unimaginable number, but after coming to the United States, I believed in the advertisements that anything is possible. Before studying abroad, Lao Ganma was a sausage. After arriving in the United States, talking about Laoganma, it feels like China, and eating Laoganma is refreshing. Before coming, the mobile phone is for text messages and shows. At this point, the mobile phone is used for voice, and if the style is concerned, Ai, let's go. Back in China, the supermarket was a busy place to go. Now, it has become a good place for entertainment. The standard of living has declined! In math class, listening to an Asian teacher say that American students make mistakes generation by generation.. One word, the number is cool! At this time, I feel so proud to be Chinese! !
