 must-see when studying abroad: There are six factors to consider when going to high school in the United States. More and more parents want to send their children to high school in the United States as soon as possible. Good American University. It sounds good, but in fact, you may wish to consider the following issues: 1. Only private high schools in the United States are open to foreign students, so the cost is expensive. 2. Although the private management of American high schools is stricter than that of public schools, there is still a lot of "freedom". In terms of adaptation, psychological preparations must be made. Otherwise, not only will the study fail, but the moral character will also deteriorate. 3. Have a comprehensive understanding of the school's location, scale, equipment, history, clubs, class size, accommodation conditions, and the opening of the school. Never use the location of relatives and friends as the only important factor for reference. 4. Students who are above the first grade (10th grade) do not need to go to the United States to study high school. The reason is that the domestic high school has already completed the high school courses, and it takes time to adapt to the local high school and language, which may eventually lead to high school Graduation time is delayed, and no new cultural courses can be learned. Generally speaking, the gains outweigh the losses. 5. Please note that unless you have studied in the United States for more than 4 years (some are three years), you can apply to American universities to waive language tests (such as TOEFL or IELTS). 6. As foreign students, we must be enrolled in English classes at the beginning. After meeting the requirements, we can enter other cultural classes at the same time. The length of time depends on the individual level.
