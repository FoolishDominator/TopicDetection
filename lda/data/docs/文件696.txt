Sri Lankan youth surfing upside down at sea (Photos) Sina Technology News Beijing September 6 news, according to the British "Daily Mail" report, anyone who has tried will agree with the view that surfing is too difficult. Amazingly, a young Sri Lankan named Dulip Kokuhannadige could surf upside down. The 22-year-old surprised other surfers by performing a stunt in Bournemouth, England - handstand surfing. Now, people are flocking to his frequent presence near the pier to see him perform, where he can stay upside down on the top of the waves for 15 seconds. The construction worker had tried to teach his friend to surf handstands, but no one had been able to learn the stunt. Kokuhanna Teague first discovered he could surf upside down when he was teaching a group of teenagers to surf after the 2004 Asian tsunami. When that tsunami hit, he and his parents were just 30 feet (9 meters) from the beach. They were lucky to escape, but their shop, house and farm on the beach were gone. He was able to stay on the board for a few seconds on his first handstand attempt, proving he has a talent. After moving to the UK in 2005, Kokuhanna Teague continued to practice the move and now spends most of his time surfing his head in the ocean.
