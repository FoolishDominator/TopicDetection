Winning the Spurs can be counted as winning a game and a half. A reporter asked straight to the point: "I know the Rockets desperately need a victory, what would be the difference if they could beat the Spurs away?" Battier replied: "If it is such a high-quality victory, probably It can be regarded as a game and a half. Because the Spurs' away game is so difficult to play." This time Battier will mainly face the Spurs' small forward Richard Jefferson. After a disappointing season after switching to the Spurs, Jefferson has started the year in great shape. "He looks more confident playing now," Battier said. "The Spurs' GDP trio has been playing together for a long, long time, and they know each other where they go and where they're used to shooting. , It does take a long time to integrate into a system. This is also an important part of training camp, I think he is well prepared this year." In the last game against the Hornets, the Rockets were not good at the opponent's pick-and-roll defense. , this time will face Parker's breakthrough, what is the difference in the rocket's countermeasures? "It's not a huge difference," Battier said. "Tony doesn't hold the ball for as long as Paul does, but he's a little bit quicker in the pick-and-roll and gives the defense a lot. Pressure, putting a lot of pressure on the big man in the paint. We need to try to keep him out of the paint and force him to make jumpers. We need to follow our pick-and-roll guidelines very well in that regard. The Spurs are playing a little bit faster this year than before. , and selectively play some fast breaks, sometimes you don't even think this is the Spurs. We need to improve the defense in transition." (Houston China Times Volcano Birds)
