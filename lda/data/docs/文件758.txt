The mainland stock market has ended its uptrend. Hong Kong stocks will try again in the short term, supporting Zhuang Zhihao, manager of the research department of Zhifu Securities. The US stock market has fallen significantly recently, dragging down the Asia-Pacific stock market generally. However, the mainland stock market stabilized slightly, and the decline of Hong Kong stocks did not expand significantly. The Hang Seng Index closed at 19,522 points, down 350 points or 1.8%; the national index fell 149 points or 1.3% to 11,192 points. Trading was quiet throughout the day, with turnover down to 53.4 billion yuan. The National Development and Reform Commission announced an increase in the price of refined oil yesterday, driving PetroChina A shares (Shanghai: 601857) up 0.9%. However, H shares (00857) did not follow suit and closed down 1.7% to 8.51 yuan. CNOOC (00883) also fell 1.95% to 10.04 Yuan; Sinopec (00386), which also benefited, bucked the trend and rose 0.8% to 6.59 yuan. Morgan Stanley pointed out that the latest price increase of refined oil products in the mainland is still not enough to cover the cost of refining, but it is estimated that Sinopec's refining business is expected to achieve break-even this month; Above $80 will be a rebate in corporate profits, and the current oil price has risen to about 70 yuan, so it will be difficult for future price increases to catch up with the increase in oil prices. The mainland stock market opened high and closed low throughout August, ending a 7-month streak of gains, with the biggest monthly drop in 15 years, indicating that the upswing of the mainland stock market since October last year is likely to have ended, and it will be difficult to return in the short term. High; the decline in new loans, the lifting of the ban and the listing of new shares in the next few months will further tighten the market funds. I believe that there is little chance of A-shares rebounding sharply. As the first market in the world to show a clear uptrend, its downtrend will also limit the upside potential of other markets and therefore Hong Kong stocks. In the short term, Hong Kong stocks opened lower yesterday due to the influence of US stocks, and the decline did not further expand, indicating that the selling pressure has been digested for the time being; however, the level of 20200 to 20600 has constituted a major pressure, and the Hang Seng Index is expected to be lowered to 19000 to 19400. There is obvious support. (ZenTong) has _COUNT_ comments I want to comment
