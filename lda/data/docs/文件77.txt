Oberto returns to the Spurs as Yao Ming left, the Rockets visit the San Antonio Spurs tonight. Their home stadium, AT&T Center, is notoriously the devil's home. But today the court also reflects the tender side. Former Spurs champion center Oberto announced his retirement after a heart rhythm was detected after switching to the Portland Trail Blazers. Oberto also returned to his former home to watch the game today. During the first timeout of the first quarter, the Spurs' home court specially put up a big screen to welcome Oberto's return, and all the fans stood up and applauded the former partner next to Duncan. Oberto also waved and greeted everyone. In the passage and locker room of the arena, many staff and former teammates greeted him cordially and asked about his situation. Ginobili, who is also his teammate, also said in an interview after the game: "I am very happy that both Oberto and Scola came to this arena today. They are my best friends. So tonight It was a lot of fun for me." Probably that's why Manu was on fire in today's game and ultimately helped the Spurs beat the Rockets. Today, the new Brazilian center of the Spurs, the former MVP of the Spanish league, Splitter, stood in the center position for the first time, which also showed the continuity of the international column of the Spurs. While lamenting the solidarity and humanity of the Spurs team, it also reminds people of the desolation of the Houston Rockets in treating their heroic center Olajuwon. In 2001, the Rockets traded the champion who played 17 seasons to the bitterly cold Toronto. We also sincerely hope that Yao Ming, who has played for the Rockets since 2002, can be respected enough by the team, especially in today's Rockets, which pays more and more attention to bombardment tactics.
