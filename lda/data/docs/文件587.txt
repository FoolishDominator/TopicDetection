Romantic Terran Tod officially retired and bid farewell to Warcraft Preface: Romantic Terran TOD had announced his retirement before, but before this year's WCG, he made a comeback and said that his goal was the championship of Chengdu WCG2009, but he failed to do so. Quietly retired, do not know if he will come back? I got news today that the French romantic man Tod has officially retired from the magic altar after the end of IEST. Although this retirement has not been officially announced, it has been confirmed from the mouth of the French team Millenium.w3. At IEST, Tod has revealed that there is a poker team to sign him. It seems that Tod, who has no more interest in Warcraft, has really left. We also wish him the best of luck in the future. This is a photo of Tod at the IEST2009 finals. This is also the last Warcraft event Tod participated in. Tod retired for the first time because he was dissatisfied with the balance of the game, and he lost interest in the game. The reason is to meet new challenges. Tod is a great player. WCG has won 2nd, 3rd and 4th, won a WEM championship, and created a mix of Terran tactical against NE. His tactical play is very exciting, although he There have been many criticisms in his career, but he is definitely a Warcraft player and eSports player who can be remembered forever.
