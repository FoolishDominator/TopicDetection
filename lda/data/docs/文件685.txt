NASA develops electronic nose that can sniff out cancer cells The future moves from rocket science to brain surgery, instructing surgeons to operate on cancer patients. The electronic nose, called "Enose," was developed at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, and is designed to detect tiny ammonia leaks from the space shuttle. This instrument is developed on the basis of a polymer membrane, which changes its conductivity when it encounters different substances. Now the developers of the "Enose" electronic nose believe that the electronic nose can be used as a highly sensitive detector to detect specific components produced by cancer cells. Doctors now rely on visual inspection to locate the cancerous tissue and double-check it with scans before surgery. Determining the exact location of tumor tissue is a tricky task for surgeons, and this instrument can go a long way toward smooth operation. For example, it is not easy to distinguish brain tissue from cancer cells, and the shape of the brain changes when the cranial cavity is opened, so the scan results are not the same as what the surgeon finally sees. Therefore, in this case, it is extremely difficult for doctors to completely remove the cancerous tissue without destroying the healthy part. Lung cancer and diabetes were recently correctly diagnosed by having a patient breathe air into the Enose electronic nose, says Barbuck Kettleb of Duarte Medical Center in California. Kettleb and his colleagues believe the device could also be linked to other brain imaging and mappers to produce a real-time high-resolution picture of the brain that shows exactly where cancerous tissue is.
