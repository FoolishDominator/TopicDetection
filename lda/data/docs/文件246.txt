Interwetten, bet365, Weide, Yishengbo and other companies have also maintained the level of compensation above 5.00, and are optimistic about the home team's victory. The bookmakers are so inclined towards Rome, and their confidence is undoubtedly based on the trust in the attacking power of Rome's home court. Because of the strong Chelsea in the same group, it is very important for Roma to grab points at home. In addition, the loss to Palermo last weekend has already exposed the club's reservations about this battle. Comprehensive analysis, the home team's victory in this battle is worth looking forward to. Star team VS Bayern Munich Yishengbo and Interwetten also offered a 1.80 away match. William Hill, bet365, and Coral all lowered their away win to around 1.80. As for SSP, they even offered a 1.75 away match. Winning shows optimism.
