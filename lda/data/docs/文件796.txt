Long-term bear market species, but this week gapped back above the bear market trap, it is recommended to pay attention to whether the high point near 9.8 can break through.

What are the pressure and support levels? Greatful! (2009-12-09 22:34:15) Expert [King Warren] Answer: The weekly chart is not ideal. A continuous inside day pattern after the reversal weekly candlestick appears. A drop below last week's weekly low may be on the verge of a relatively large decline. 8.35 is the resistance level. That's it for today, I wish you all a happy investment. (2009-12-09 22:36:19) Anonymous asked: Kimi do you admire those investment masters?

However, I am more of a graphic school, so if it sounds bad, I am a speculator. I mainly use the weekly chart as a trading reference.

((2009-12-09 22:25:14) Expert [King Warren] A: I would consider it a false breakthrough if the low point fell below yesterday, and I would be bullish if the high point broke overnight. (2009-12-09 22:28: 11) fieldtyty asked: Mr. KIMI, during this time, the short-term operation of A-shares has become more and more difficult. According to my feeling, A-shares will enter a relatively long adjustment period. Is it time to rest during this period? (2009-12- 09 22:24:16) Expert [King Warren] A: During this period of time, the choice of individual stocks has been tested. The market is not in an ideal bull market state. Rest is a good choice (2009-12-09 22:27:01) Anonymous asked: Mr. KIMI, how to look at the cost of FUQI, 20.5 (2009-12-09 22:23:59) Expert [King Warren] Answer: It seems that if you hold the recent low, there will be a rebound, 22.5 is the initial resistance, and 25 seems to be quite difficult. (2009-12-09 22:26:16) Anonymous asked: kimi how about the bx thanks(2009-12-09 22:18:47) Expert [warren king] A: It seems to be a downward trend, tending to rebound Sell. The 12.5/11.6 support area will affect more trends in the midline, and strengthen the bearish view after it falls below. (2009-12-09 22:23:26) Anonymous Question: Hello, Mr. Wang! IAG is high and buy. Yes Waiting for long-term holdings to unwind, or liquidating positions and then buying again after falling.

(2009-12-09 22:18:47) Expert[ King warren] Answer: Reverse the weekly K line and sell on a rebound. The support near 16 may provide a chance to rebound and leave the market (2009-12-09 22:24:29) Anonymous question: Mr. KIMI, the appreciation of the US dollar has increased the value of China's US dollar reserves , Will the Yankees let China take advantage? (2009-12-09 22:17:02) Expert [Wang Warren] Answer: The influence of the appreciation of the US dollar is not only the reserve, after all, the reserve just looks beautiful. Many other influences will hurt China very much.(2009-12-09 22:21:46) Anonymous Question: Hello Mr. KIMI! What are the support and resistance levels of DHI?(2009-12-09 22:12 :32) Expert [Warren Wang] A: Bearish trend, falling below 10.5 is a big resistance. Weekly level support is at 8 yuan, if the short-term stabilizes in the weak support area of 9.6/9.7 and rebounds at 10.5, it is recommended to sell on rallies ( 2009-12-09 22:15:05) Anonymous asked: KIMI teacher, hello! 000939's Where is the pressure? Thanks! Thanks! Thanks! ! ! (2009-12-09 22:11:25) Expert [King Warren] Answer: 17.6 is the initial resistance, and the top is naturally a high of 18.49 (2009-12-09 22:18:07) Anonymous asked: Hello, Mr. KIMI! I think whether the devaluation of the U.S. dollar is not depreciated is the most important thing to see if the devaluation is beneficial to the United States! Do you think so? Is the devaluation of the dollar good or bad for the US? (2009-12-09 22:09:49) Expert [King Warren] A: Generally speaking, it can be understood in this way. Economists I like more think the US won't let the dollar depreciate too much. (2009-12-09 22:12:49) Anonymous asked: Teacher is humble! ! ! Thank you. 600019 Resistance 9.9-10 ? (2009-12-09 22:09:44) Expert [King Warren] A: 9.36 is the short-term immediate resistance, and obviously it is the resistance of the recent high point of 10.33. 8.65 is an important short-term support. (2009-12-09 22:17:11) Anonymous asked: KIMI is good, will oil prices fall? What do you think of A-share coal stocks? How about 600123? (2009-12-09 22:05:58) Expert [Warren Wang] A: I think the US dollar has at least rebounded at a large level in the past 2 months, or even reversed, so I tend to be bearish on crude oil and precious metals. If 41.35/40.38 falls below, it is best to wait and see. (2009-12-09 22:10:55) Anonymous asked: Teacher, hello! It's been the third night to ask for advice, and I hope to be ranked first. 000012 What is the short-term support and pressure? Thank you very much! (2009-12-09 22:03:49) Expert [King Warren] Answer: 20.29/21.05 is what I think is the bull trap position, and I think there will be resistance there. 18.61/17.15 is regarded as short-term support (2009-12-09 22:09:06) Anonymous question: Mr. KIMI, how do you see the trend of the US stock market in the next few months? Has it peaked? Thanks! (2009-12-09 22:01:15) Expert [Warren Wang] A: Given my view on the US dollar, I am inclined to see a relatively large correction in US stocks; After rebounding to the current high (or even slightly higher), my current judgment is to sell on rallies.

(2009-12-09 21:59:06) Expert [King Warren] A: I don't dare to be too strong. 10.36/10.40 is the most important support in my opinion. (2009-12-09 22:04:04) Anonymous Question: Ask the teacher: What is the support point of BAC? (2009-12-09 21:56:12) Expert [King Warren] A: 14 is a very important support, so just focus on 15.2 in the short term. Short-term resistance 16.8. In addition, the indicators I use for the weekly line have signs of deviating from the top. If the weekly line effectively falls below 14, there will be a relatively large decline (2009-12-09 22:00:49) Anonymous Question: Hello KIMI! I don't know how you feel about the A-share market? Feeling a little warm boiled frog ah! (2009-12-09 21:52:05) Expert [King Warren] A: If the short-term support is 3214, if the midline 3080 falls below, I will be bearish. Since the short-term resistance area is relatively close, it is mainly to avoid risks. After all, if it can effectively break through 3361/3478, it is not too late to do more, and the current price is also 3-6% away from the above point. (2009-12-09 21:56:08) Anonymous asked: Hello KIMI, are you replacing Warren for the second time? Haha, I don't know which sector of A shares you are most optimistic about (preferably individual stocks)? What A shares do you hold? Thank you (2009-12-09 21:46:58) Expert [King Warren] Answer: I'm laughing, I don't have a particularly deep research on A shares at present, most of which are just judged from graphics, so I can't make recommendations for sectors and stocks. Overall, if you are a novice, I still recommend doing some stocks with standard trends. Penny stocks are not something that ordinary people can operate. In terms of stability, 600030 CITIC Securities is relatively good. (2009-12-09 21:50:54) Anonymous asked: Hello teacher KIMI! Please help analyze LVS, the cost of 16.39, should you go or stay? Looking forward to your advice! Thanks! (2009-12-09 21:45:13) Expert [King Warren] A: If it is me, if it falls below 14.95, it will stop loss and close the position, and short-term bulls are not dominant. 13 is an important midline turning point.

It is very simple, if the government does not stick the needle, the world economy will be in a great depression, and it will not dare to tighten the printing of money. Teacher, what do you think? (2009-12-09 21:23:50) Expert [King Warren] A: Whether gold is bullish or not depends on the dollar, and European banks have made it clear that they will tighten monetary policy. Printing money again will cause the Great Depression. Personally, I don't think I can be too optimistic about gold after the weekly reversal, at least in the short-term.

Thank you! !(2009-12-09 20:47:03) Expert [King Warren] Answer: I don't know the fundamentals, because the gap fell below the 7.42 support position today, so the short-term is still not ideal.
