Betfair Index's hotline tracking Villa Blackburn's hot sale can be a winner. The Premier League team Germany will continue to play the leading role in this issue. The three major giants of the Premier League are all facing elements whose strength is only in the middle and lower reaches. I believe the chance of taking all 3 points is quite high. , so it is expected that the winnings of this issue will not be too high. Aston Villa was once again the most popular in the match day transaction market. I remember that although Villa only played on Sunday last week, the transaction volume was still the highest in each game. As a result, they beat Manchester City in the second half. The second guest, Stoke City, once again became the focus of the market. More than 3 million yuan has been invested in the afternoon of the match day. The transaction volume is higher than that of the three giants, and the transaction odds are also getting hotter. If the Betfair historical index data of Yiqiu.com is used for in-depth analysis, Villa had a very high winning rate when the index was above 70 last season. In addition, the newly promoted horses in the past four seasons have suffered a lot at the beginning of the season. When the face is bearish, the defeat rate is extremely high, so the winner of this event may wish to choose the guest to win the game.
