(2009-01-09 21:17:47) Expert [King Warren] Answer: This stock is still oscillating up and down. I think the future trend will depend on the following two factors: 1) The trend of the broader market; 2) Whether the main force is willing to pull High, small-cap sub-new stocks are more popular now, so if the main force is willing to pull up, this stock will still rush. Right now, it's still volatile. (2009-01-09 21:17:47) Netizen [anonymous] asked: Hello Mr. Wang! Please point out the support and pressure level of 600069 in your busy schedule?
