Swedish study finds pets snore as young as adults, Swedish researchers have found that keeping pets at home may increase the risk of snoring in children at home as adults. Carl Franklin, a scholar at Ume√• University Hospital in Sweden, led a research team to randomly select 15,500 people in several Nordic countries to conduct a survey. Respondents were asked to answer questions about childhood living conditions and whether they snored. The survey results showed that 18% of the respondents "snored disturbing others at least 3 days a week", and this group was mostly close to pets as a child and a history of respiratory or ear infection in childhood. The researchers found that those who had contact with dogs as infants belonged to a group that was likely to snore as adults. "These factors may exacerbate inflammation in people when they are young, which in turn triggers structural changes in the upper airway that increase the risk of snoring in adulthood," the researchers said in the report. The research results are published in the latest issue of the medical journal Respiratory Research, published by the British Biomedical Centre Press. (Xinhua News Agency special telegram)
