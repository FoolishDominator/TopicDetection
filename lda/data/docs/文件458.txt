Smarter Classroom Speaker at Education Festival: Brian Cox Who would have thought that Brian Cox, the famous British rock star before, has now turned into a particle physics expert. Someone must remember the glorious moment when Brian and his band (Dream and Challenge) traveled the world and toured successfully many times. Like many successful people, Brian did not waste his time, but continued to seize the time to learn. He eventually graduated with first class from the University of Manchester and continued his postgraduate studies at the University of Hamburg. He is now a professor and lectures publicly at the University of Manchester. And he's working on the revolutionary Hadron Collider project at CERN in Switzerland. At CERN, Brian Cox oversees an international project to upgrade the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) for the Giant Atlas and CMS detectors. One of the newest machines there is 27 kilometers long and has a small silicon detector almost half a mile away from the inner particles at the Hadron Collider. Brian's contributions to popularizing science are also widely recognized. In 2002, he was selected as an International Fellow of the Explorers Club. The group is chaired by Edmund Hillary, and other members include Neil Armstrong and General Chuck Yeager. In 2006, Brian Cox received an award from the Lord Kelvin Society in the United Kingdom. Reward him for his contributions to popularizing science.
