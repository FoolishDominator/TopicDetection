AMD pushes 812-core server processors to counterattack Intel AMD today officially launched the latest 8-core and 12-core series processor products, which officially blew the horn of attack to Intel in the server field. AMD's 8-core and 12-core server processors both use a new 45-nanometer design, and they are also built by packaging two processor dies together. The 12-core processor is based on the previously exposed Magny-Cours core. That is, two 6-core Istanbul cores are packaged together, and an 8-core processor is built by packaging two 4-core processor dies together. The new 8-core and 12-core processors will support the new G34 socket, which provides updated I/O technology, and each processor can support up to 12 memory sockets because it can support four DDR3 memory channels. The newly launched 8-core and 12-core processor products will belong to the Opteron 6100 series, with a minimum starting frequency of 1.8GHz, of which the minimum version of the 8-core processor is Opteron 6124 HE, and the highest version of the series is the main frequency. 12-core Opteron 6176 SE at 2.3GHz. In the Opteron 6100 series, the 1.8GHz 8-core Opteron 6124 HE has a low power consumption of only 65W, and the specific price is 455 US dollars, which is equivalent to 3100 yuan. The 12-core Opteron 6176 SE clocked at 2.3GHz has a power consumption of 105W and is priced at $1,386, or about 9,466 yuan. The specifications and prices of other products are mostly in between these two products. In terms of performance, the AMD Opteron 6100 series is much more powerful than the previous 6-core Istanbul processor. According to AMD, the performance of integer operations has been improved by 88%, and the performance of floating-point operations has been improved by as much as 119%. The Opteron 6000 series of server platforms will mainly be equipped with four or two sockets, which means that the number of cores in the entry-level system is 16, while the number of cores in the high-end system can be as high as 48. In contrast to AMD, Intel is also planning to launch an 8-core chip product for the multi-processor server market. This product is also called "Nehalem-EX", and this product should be not far from the official launch.
