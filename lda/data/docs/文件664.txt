Swiss Rocketman is about to fly over the English Channel The first person to fly a powered wing across the English Channel. Last week, Rossi carried an 8-foot-long jet-powered wing on his back for a 10-minute test flight over a distance of more than 22 miles, the equivalent of flying from Dover to Calais. Rossi, 48, tested his powered wing for the first time in May after four years of design and production. Rossi, the self-proclaimed "Rocketman", flew for more than five minutes at 8,200 feet after jumping out of a plane. The power wing, made of carbon fiber material, houses four small engines, and Rossi can control the fuel with a lever. During a flight test last week, which had been delayed several times because of engine problems, Rossi jumped from a small plane 7,500 feet above the Swiss town of Bex and flew in clear skies. After flying to Villeneuve, it flew back. Wearing a heat-resistant suit like a race car driver, he opened two parachutes at 5,000 feet and 4,000 feet respectively, landing at Bakerstown Airport with 2 liters of fuel left in the engine. He said: "Everything went well. The flight was fantastic, the longest I've ever flown with this power wing. If there were no technical glitches, it would be no problem to fly across the English Channel." Flying across the English Channel on March 24, the event will be broadcast live to 165 countries via the National Geographic Channel. "This flight will be a gift to the pioneers, many of whom lost their lives," he said. During an early test flight three years ago, he lost control in the air and landed just below the ground. The parachute did not open until 1600 feet. (Xiaowen)
