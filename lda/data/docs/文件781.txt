Do you still need to adjust? Is CICC Gold available to buy? (2009-10-30 20:43:42) Expert [King Warren] A: If you are on the Shanghai Stock Exchange, pay attention to 3067-3069, turn it over and do more, or wait and see for the time being. You can take a look at my Weibo analysis http://t.sina.com.cn/warrenwang2008 Zhongjin Gold is still a very strange graph, just lurking when it should be hidden, otherwise, it is better to wait for the gold price to break through the previous high.

(2009-10-30 20:56:53) Anonymous asked: AAI has fallen a lot, how is the trend going? (2009-10-30 20:54:14) Expert [King Warren] Answer: The airline sector has been falling very sharply recently. Recently, brokers including JP MORGAN have also upgraded this stock, but the impact of rising oil prices is relatively large!

(2009-10-30 21:05:40) Anonymous asked: Boss, A-shares rebounded earlier than US stocks during the financial crisis, and now A-shares seem to adjust earlier than US stocks! So I thought, if the U.S. stock market adjusts, then gold should continue to fall! But at this time, the A-share market is improving, so where should the A-share gold stocks go? Is it up or down? (2009-10-30 21:03:07) Expert [Warren Wang] A: If the US economy continues to weaken, a new stimulus bill will be introduced, more money will be printed, and gold will rise. If the U.S. economy is strong, inflation will spark asset bubbles and gold will rise. This is the logic, gold will be bullish in the medium and long term. (2009-10-30 21:13:30) Anonymous question: Does ICBC have long-term investment value? It's far away. I like China Merchants Bank. There is also an article about China Merchants Bank in my blog.

(2009-10-30 21:20:10) Anonymous asked: Mr. Wang, I think the tradable share capital of GEM is very small! The smallest Huaxing has only 8 million tradable shares. At its current price of 45 yuan, if I buy all these 8 million shares, it will cost 360 million. If all the tradable shares are in my own hands, then this stock is behind What will happen? There is no transaction every day, what will happen? (2009-10-30 21:19:01) Expert [King Warren] Answer: If you buy all the circulating shares with money, the shares will go to the sky, and the company will also issue additional shares and sell shares from the inventory. The stake will be diluted soon, which is a pointless operation, and it is better to lose it, unless the long-term stock is really good.
