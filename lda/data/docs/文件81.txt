Xiao Li could have ended the game with a 3-point bet at the end. Ah Shuai didn't designate anyone. free throws. But he missed both free throws, leaving the opponent with a chance to tie. In the end, Ginobili hit a mid-range shot and dragged the game into overtime. After the game, Li was very sad. After taking a shower, he sat in the chair and remained silent for a while, holding a towel and covering his head in frustration for a while. When the author tried to ask him about the two free throws, Li said in a low voice: "That opportunity could have ended the game and opened the gap between two goals, but I missed it. There's not much to say, I I don't know what happened." In the final seconds of overtime, the Rockets missed three consecutive 3-pointers. The author asked Li what the coaching arrangement was like at the time, and did he intend to let him attack? Li replied, "The coach said at the time that the shot was to see who had a better chance and didn't specify who it was." I continued, "When you were shooting a 3-pointer from the top of the arc, you felt that chance How's it going?" "Manu Ginobili stood in front of me." Lee sighed, "He almost completely covered me, but I ran out of time, so I could only choose to shoot threes from that far away. "The Rockets sold Ariza for Kootenay Lee this summer. He was not expected to perform as expected. After Martin left the court with an injury in the third quarter, Li, who replaced Martin, led the Rockets to a desperate situation, and also had a fast-break layup to overtake the score in overtime. I hope these two key free throw mistakes will not affect his mentality, because one day later, he is likely to continue to replace Martin's previous role and take on the heavy responsibility of shooting guard.
