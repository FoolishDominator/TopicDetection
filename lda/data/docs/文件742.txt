I reminded everyone when I was sitting in the court last week that the trend of bank stocks will be weaker than the market. I still think that the trend of bank stocks will be weaker than the market in 2009. I reminded the risk of C again. Of course, the cost of BAC12.1 is not high. , there is no problem with the solution, but I am not optimistic about the mid-term.

(2009-07-22 20:22:37) Expert [aries Gao] Answer: After Wuliangye's high volume breakthrough, it has started to fluctuate recently. I believe it will take time to digest it.

(2009-07-22 20:37:40) Expert [aries Gao] Answer: The trend of C is enough to show that C is indeed weaker than the broader market. If it cannot be favored by institutions, it will be difficult for individual investors to lift C up. (2009-07-22 20:37:40) Netizen [Anonymous] asked: Mr. Gao, I have some RF and KEY, micro sleeves in my hand. Are you cutting meat or filling positions now? (2009-07-22 20:38:24) Expert [aries Gao] Answer: The trend of RF and KEY is not very optimistic. It can be seen from these two stocks that you prefer to buy on dips, but the market situation is often The good ones are getting better and better, and the bad ones are getting weaker and weaker. Therefore, when choosing stocks with a callback opportunity, be sure to choose some stocks with relatively strong fundamentals and avoid those stocks with new lows. Personally, these two stocks do not rule out oversold and rebound, but the long-term trend is not very good?
