British doctors use elbow to reconstruct shoulder for amputee boy (picture) Fletcher's 15-year-old boy Tom Lemm had his leg amputated at Leeds General Hospital. For a 15-year-old kid, we can't get over what it means to lose an entire arm. Luckily, Lyme underwent another successful limb reconstruction after the amputation, in which doctors reconstructed a new shoulder using tissue and muscle extracted from the unaffected elbow. It is believed that such an operation is the first time in British history. Lyme's surgeons say that with the new shoulder, they can fit Lyme's prosthesis. During the procedure, the entire arm and shoulder joint are removed. After this, the surgeon reconstructs the shoulder joint with the elbow joint and tissue taken from the excised arm. Specifically, a metal disc was implanted into Lyme's collarbone, and the new joint was grafted on the shoulder. Professor Simon Kay, who oversaw the operation, told the BBC: "The scariest thing for an upper limb reconstructive surgeon is to remove the patient's entire arm. The amputated arm is not useless, you can still use it to benefit patients." Simon said Lime's new shoulder can support the prosthesis. "It would be a huge advantage." The first such operation was performed in Japan. Simon believes that Lyme's operation should be the first in British or European history. A hospital spokesman said: "We are delighted to see Lyme recovering day by day. Lyme is very pleased with the results of the operation at Leeds General Hospital. We wish him a healthy and happy life in the days to come." Lyme, who contracted cancer three years ago, told reporters: "I was terrified of losing my arm, but after the professor told me what he was going to do, it became an anticipation. This operation has given me hope, and I hope it can help more people." (Xiaowen)
