Photographer took pictures of elephants playing and playing in the quagmire (Photos) Elephants' "private swimming pool" Elephants have to "queue" while enjoying the quagmire. Be careful not to bury in the mud according to the British "Daily Mail" ” reported that a photographer recently took a picture of a group of elephants playing in the mud in the summer of Saburu National Park in the remote northern region of Kenya. The elephants rolled in the rust-red mud, which was very like enjoying Human family on summer vacation. The photos taken by the photographer are also very much like a holiday photo album for the elephant family. The photos show that the elephants living in Saburu National Park, a 65-square-mile park made up of highlands and rivers, are far from humans. The baby elephants play happily, sometimes jumping with excitement, while the adult elephants guard them by their side. Elephants are very fond of mud baths, turning red as they roll in the rust-red mud. The baby elephants were so happy to be able to enjoy the mud bath that the adult elephants joined them later. In fact, mud baths can play a role in sun protection, repelling insects, cooling, and it is also a way for elephants to play happy games. Like the trouble with modern human family vacations, elephants have to queue for mud baths. Elephant herd families have a very complex structure, each group consists of 8-10 kinship female elephants and their offspring (both male and female), the eldest and largest female elephant is the elephant group leader. The baby elephant stayed with its mother until the age of 12. Male elephants will be expelled from the female herd when they reach the age of 12, and the males will live alone, only rejoining the herd when they are ready to breed.
