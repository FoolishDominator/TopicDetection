Venezuela's new fossils reveal the secrets behind the connection between North and South continents A saber-toothed tiger found in South America. Scientists say the discovery means more discoveries to come. The fossils are 1.8 million years old and include the skulls and jaws of six saber-toothed tigers with curved teeth. Compared to other saber-toothed tiger species, this tiger has shorter and narrower canine teeth. Researchers led by Venezuelan paleontologist Ascanio Rincon announced the discovery this month. They say the discovery not only proves that the saber-toothed tiger once lived locally, but also provides a rare window into the state of the environment shortly after the North and South continents were connected. Larry Martin, a professor at the University of Kansas, said: "This discovery is one of the most striking and interesting in the past 10 years. This species has not been found in South America before." The tar crater is larger than two football fields and is located in the east The oil-rich state of Monagas. The findings suggest that the saber-toothed tiger moved from North America to South America after North and South America came together after 65 million years of separation and joined together in what is now Panama, the researchers said. Argentine paleontologist Francisco Prevosti called the Venezuelan discovery "the most important discovery in South American paleontology." He and some other experts say the now-extinct saber-toothed cat was thought to have lived in Africa, Europe, Asia and North America, but never in South America.
