Today is a great day for the public launch of K2 Real Estate's first high-quality residential project in Tongzhou area. There are two things today: the first is the launching ceremony of Haitang Bay, which marks that Haitang Bay has undergone our development, planning, gardening, and architecture. After nine months of polishing and construction, the team was officially released. With an inclusive mood and mind, we welcome every friend to give guidance. Only in this way can we go further; the second thing is the happy day when our project and Greentown Property officially signed a contract. Both Greentown Property and K2 Property are there It has led the development of the industry to varying degrees, so this is an innovation for the Tongzhou area, which will fill the gap of high-quality residential and high-end property services in this area. China's real estate has gone through three stages of development. The first stage is to build a house, the second stage is to create a scenery, and the second stage is to build a home. We carefully plan, carefully build, and strive to create every detail to improve product quality and create a comfortable home for every buyer. Life in K2·Haitang Bay is a vacation. I hope everyone here today has a holiday-like mood and experience. I also hope that more friends will choose K2·Haitang Bay to vacation here. Moderator: K2 Real Estate has been committed to providing customers with the best quality products and the best services, relying on strong talent advantages, to become a powerful real estate development enterprise. Today is the opening ceremony of our model area. Once again, we invite our general manager Mr. Wu Jinchi and the deputy prime minister of the project, Mr. Li Guangtian, to come to the stage to unveil the opening ceremony of our model area. We see in this golden book scroll, which will present a beautiful picture for everyone. With the opening of this scroll, we saw a beautiful silk painting and found it so rich in connotation and poetry. We thank you both again. I believe that many friends at the scene will become loyal readers of this beautiful scroll with connotation and poetry in the future. I think with the opening of this scroll, you will be full of yearning for K2·Haitang Bay. The picture shows Wu Jinchi, general manager of K2 Haitang Bay, and Li Guangtian, deputy prime minister of the project, for the opening of the model area. We also invited three guests to the scene today. The three friends we invited are Mr. Yao Jiangang, the design director of K2 Real Estate, and the other is Sun Xiangshu of the project planning and construction company Weituo Times Architectural Design Co., Ltd., and the last one is Mr. Hua Bai of Bai nationality. Today is indeed different from all the opening activities I have attended before. We have become more relaxed. I believe that with the explanations of the three, we will have a better understanding of K2? Haitang Bay. The first question is to ask our general manager Yao. Just like writing articles, when we were young, the teacher taught us to have a central idea in writing articles. I believe that building a house must have a central idea. First of all, let me ask you, the central idea of our K2? Haitang Bay , that is, what is the planning concept? The picture shows Yao Jiangang, Design Director of K2·Real Estate, Sun Xiangshu and Bai Zuhua of Weituo Times Architectural Design Co., Ltd. interpreting K2·Haitang Bay, Mr. Yao: There are two central ideas of Haitang Bay, one is people-oriented; the other is that life is on vacation. Moderator: There are a lot of real estate projects in Beijing, especially when the real estate market is booming, what characteristics does our Haitang have to lead you? Mr. Yao: It has a lot of features, from planning buildings to products, there are very outstanding places in every place. Moderator: Mr. Sun, after all, the concept is at the ideological level, and it is only at the physical level that we can really see the foundation of an architect. Help us introduce what architectural style is when it is put into practice? Mr. Sun: In fact, some things may not be completely defined as a certain style in this era. When we are doing this project, we hope to give everyone a very long-term expectation, or it is really home. It should be a long-term home, a century-old plan, so in terms of architectural style, we did not follow fashion and trends, so in the basic tone of the so-called neoclassical style, then everyone saw its color, all Heavier, heavier colors, this kind of neoclassical we call it British and the gentleman's demeanor, including his temperament, are needed as a high-quality residence, but in this era? We don’t want to make it completely retro. The traditional three-stage style should be said to be a very important concept of classical design, but we hope to give it a little innovation on top of this, and combine the American concept to make some lines, This embodies a kind of positivity, so adapting to the development of our times, without losing its long-lasting modesty, which is an idea in the architectural style. Moderator: Actually, from here, its color is very special. I haven't found any buildings of this color in Beijing. In fact, I think a building is like a human being. It must be flesh and blood, and a person's mind I have already given it to the soul, where is the blood and where is the flesh, it depends on our garden. We just said that life is on vacation. Let us ask Mr. Bai to introduce what kind of characteristics in garden design? Mr. Bai: Naturally, maybe this sentence can sum up everything better. Because of our current living environment, people have attached too many functions. To put it bluntly, people feel tired living in it. We build this kind of garden, just Using the most natural way to give people a return to life, this is the purpose of our efforts. Moderator: It is a natural environment to adjust the busy mentality of modern people. Today, many owners and friends are looking at the house. They are actually very concerned about our greening. We can ask now, all the flowers and plants we see can be realized in the future, right? Mr. Bai: There will be more abundant content in our nature. Moderator: There will be a lot of ideas that integrate ancient times in the garden. Ask Mr. Yao: There are two words in the three characters of Haitang Bay, both of which have water. Tell us about the origin of water. Mr. Yao: At the beginning of this project, we made a short board plan. One advantage is low density, with a density of 20%. Moderator: Does low density take up a lot of your development space? Mr. Yao: We give up the largest land for greening, which is a real benefit for the buyers. What we do is greening with sunlight. Ordinary developers are the green space between the two floors. We do not block the buildings. We have built a large water system of more than 5,000 square meters, and then we are in the center. The concept we uphold is to build a good view and a good room. We built six small water systems, all of which are connected to the main water system. Moderator: So the life you just told me is a vacation. Mr. Yao: It is reflected in every detail. Moderator: Everyone can walk by the creek and go home. It's easy to say, but it's difficult to put it into a building, right? Mr. Bai: The water system is relatively difficult in the whole garden. You can see that there are so many water systems in Beijing. One is a technical problem, and the other is a relatively high development cost. Actually it is a system. Moderator: Will it be able to see water as soon as it goes out? Mr. Bai: Basically, every household can see water. This is a system, not a single point. Moderator: House type and orientation are the biggest considerations when buying a house. Mr. Sun: It should be said that according to our construction industry, it should be considered as a high-rise and high-density building, but through our design, we hope that in a high-density community, the green space rate should be increased, and the apartment size should be better. In fact, this is very difficult, we The company has done many similar high-rise and high-density projects in the past ten years, but we have made it high-quality, like the Palm Springs International Apartment we used to do (forum photo album apartment type sample room map search), Sunshine One. Hundred, Sunshine Upper East (forum photo album apartment type sample room map search), these are high-rise and high-density, but the quality is very high, so at the beginning of this project, we hope to create a very high-quality project in the eastern district of Beijing . It turns out that the high quality we think is that every house is facing the sun, the north and south are transparent, and a good landscape is enough. But now this level is basically a good thing, so in Haitang Bay, we actually hope to think from a different perspective, change from the perspective of the common people, and do the design from the perspective of the buyer. Therefore, in this design, the sales staff may tell you in the future that in the design of each apartment, we hope to provide customers with the most favorable conditions to the maximum extent, that is to say, the area given is very large, and each suite is different. The gifting method and ingenious design. In this regard, it is the same as buying things in our home. Buying a house is a big investment, just like buying a large home appliance. The home appliance originally wanted Hitachi's Panasonic, but after Haier Electric came out, it provided you with a lot of Chinese The service that people really need, in fact, we hope that our house is also a commodity, but one of the largest commodities in a family. Why should I choose this commodity? It is the performance-to-value ratio. If I spend the same money to get the value, is it right? As such, I hope to really provide benefits to everyone in this community. We have made nearly 100 types of houses. Moderator: The apartment types I have seen are also very comprehensive, with one-bedroom, two-bedroom, three-bedroom, and four-bedroom. Mr. Sun: One of the features is that in the utilization of the underground and top floors, the upper and higher floors provide them with a very good platform, and the lower and upper floors are the entrance to the south. Give it a slope and drop it, so that everyone in the basement feels sunny, completely like the feeling of being on the ground. i want to comment
