Interstellar Barbarian Chief Comes to Hengyang Changsha Players Win PCGA2009 Pepsi Super Grand Prix Hengyang Division Ends In June, Hunan has slowly entered the hot summer. In this hot season, PCGA2009 Pepsi Super Grand Prix Hunan Division Trials ushered in the second city sub-station - Hengyang Station. From June 6th to 7th, e-sports enthusiasts from Hengyang and some Changsha gathered in Hengyang Feihu.com to compete for the only place in each event to enter the Hunan final. In the StarCraft competition, China's barbarian SUPER made a special trip to Hengyang to participate in the competition, while Hengyang's native protoss JAYSTAR failed to participate in the PCGA Hengyang competition because he went to Guangzhou to participate in the WCG competition. But the arrival of SUPER also aroused the enthusiastic pursuit of Hengyang local interstellar players. However, because JAYSTAR did not participate in the competition, the result of the competition became no suspense, and SUPER did his part to get the only entry ticket to the provincial final. The DOTA competition was quite fierce. After nearly 3 hours of fierce finals, the GW team finally defeated the opponent and won the championship and entered the finals. In the Warcraft 3 game, Long Zhe, also from Changsha, defeated GORUSH from Hengyang and many others. The masters won the final championship and entered the finals.
