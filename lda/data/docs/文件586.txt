It is rumored that StarsWar, the classic event of Warcraft 3, was reborn. Last year, StarsWar, the event that was rumored to be held again, seems to be revived. Today, its founder zax updated his blog: zax: I haven't updated my blog for a long time, it's not that I don't know Write something, but there are so many things in my head that I don't know where to start. Sometimes when I type a word, my thinking has jumped to the second sentence. I really don't have the talent for coding. Today I can concentrate on one thing, and my heart is like a mirror-like lake and a surging ocean wave. It seems very contradictory, because this thing itself is exciting and makes people calm down quickly. 2 years is a long time, but the wait is worth it, the dream will be reopened one day. Persistence is taste, we have been insisting. The last words I wrote were still messy, but I just captured the feeling that flashed in my heart. The old problem of insomnia has been repeated recently, like eating a big bowl of cocaine. There are constant fantasies in front of you, colorful lights and shadows, enthusiastic audiences, and stars. Although there is no mention of StarsWar in the blog, it is inferred from the time that Starswar4 was held in ChinaJoy in July 2007, and it has been more than two years now. If this game is held again, it will stimulate the entire Warcraft and Chinese eSports. After the e-sports winter of 2009, the good news of the beginning of the year hopes to make the spring of e-sports come as soon as possible.
