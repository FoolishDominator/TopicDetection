In addition, I think this time the gold broke but the gold stocks such as NEM and GG did not react strongly. If gold pulls back, will they also fall back sharply like two weeks ago?

Anyway, I have been buying it for a long time. For gold stocks, you can also buy it on dips, buy it in batches, and wait for a period of appreciation. If you are interested in real estate, there is a five-year appreciation period, and we must have certain legal control over short-term transactions, which can prevent everyone from going short.

Do you think coal will be a strong sector following gold and non-ferrous metals? (2009-10-09 21:01:26) Expert [Warren Wang] A: I once listed a stock of Hua Ke on my blog, which was a coal stock, and it has changed a lot. Since coal is the second-largest non-renewable energy source, it is driven by the traveling wave of oil. However, due to the influence of supply and demand, oil prices are unlikely to change in the market. I am first optimistic about gold, and second optimistic about products including non-ferrous metals.
