[Lottery Weekly] He Ming's two-color ball 08099 issue: 03 is expected to be hot in the near future. Of the total 98 issues since 2008, 03 has issued a total of 19 prize numbers. Among all the 33 red ball numbers, it should be a number with a weak frequency, and it has become popular recently. The possibility is very high, and the analysis is as follows: 1. In the 38-period 08050-08088 period, the 03 award number was issued only once. From the equilibrium rate of the award number, 03 rebounded recently after experiencing a long-term cold. Space is huge. 2. Judging from the number of numbers 0, 1, and 2 in the first area (01-11) divided by three remainders, the remaining number 1 has been issued 578 (including the 2 in this issue), and the remaining number 2 has been issued 568 (including 1 in this issue), only 420 (including 06 in this issue) will be issued for the number of prizes with more than 0. Although there are only 3 numbers (03, 06, 09) with a remainder of 0 among the numbers of each road in the division of the remainder by three in District 1, it is a serious shortage. 3. Judging from the total number of the first prize number of 0, 1, and 2 in the division of three remainders, there are 300 times for the remaining number 1, 242 times for the remaining number 2, and only 227 times for the first number for the remaining 0 (including the number 1). 06) in this issue, the first number of the remaining 0 is also very large. In the 10 issues of 08089, the first number of 03 was issued, 03 has shown a trend of continuous strength, and we must continue to follow and watch in the near future. Recommended Issue 08099: Red Balls: 02, 03, 06, 07, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 25, 26, 28. Basketball: 02, 04.
