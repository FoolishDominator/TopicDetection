On April 2, the US stock market experts sat in the hall and recorded a netizen [anonymous] asking: Teacher, the US stock market opened higher, do you think it will go lower today to complete this round of correction? Will 768 be the first support for SPX? Or do you think it's much lower than 768? Thanks. (2009-04-02 20:43:26) Expert [Wang Zhanpeng] Answer: I think it should not go too low after opening high. Now there are a lot of OTC funds looking for opportunities to open positions. I agree with your point of view 768 is The first support for spx. (2009-04-02 20:43:26) Netizen [Anonymous] asked: Dear Mr. Wang, hello! I really hope you can sit here every day. May I ask at what price can BAC enter today? The resistance level of this wave of market How much is it? It is estimated that this wave of market will end before BAC publishes the financial statement of the previous quarter on April 25? Thank you for your answer! Open high and the price breaks through the high point of the first five-minute K-line to enter. The stock resistance is near 10 yuan. I think this wave of the market can reach 15 yuan (within half a year). (2009-04-02 21:09:36) Netizen [Anonymous] asked: Mr. Wang, hello! The WFC I bought for $20 and the C I bought for $3.56 were all caught. Please advise me how to operate this now. Two stocks? In addition, for the three bank stocks of WFC, C, BAC, should the correct operation strategy be to buy only one of them, or can all three be involved at the same time? Which one do you recommend? Thank you! Good health , Everything goes well! (2009-04-02 21:12:05) Expert [Wang Zhanpeng] Answer: Then take it first, I am more optimistic about bac among the three, bac is responsible for the salary distribution of all employees of the US government, if He's bankrupt and the president doesn't get the money either.

The operating discipline is very inspired. In the past, I always carried it more and more, but now it seems to be an extreme mistake. What I would like to ask you is -- if you are short-term, should you follow the 5-minute and 10-minute K-line when entering and exiting. How valuable are these two K-lines to ultra-short-term ones? Why do some mainland analysts scoff at it? I am very skeptical of those analysts now. Please help? (2009-04-02 21:28:44) Expert [Wang Zhanpeng] Answer: The US stock market is very different from China's t+1 transaction because it is a t+0 transaction. In addition, the transaction fee is not proportional, but a fixed transaction fee is charged for each transaction, so the short-term entry and exit costs are very high. Low, if you want to do short-term trading, it is better to operate US stocks.(2009-04-02 21:28:44) Netizen [Anonymous] asked: Mr. Wang: Hello!
