White-Ra: I like the singing of Chengdu girls. The WCG schedule is entering into the second day, and all the competitions are in full swing. Today (12th), a reporter from Full Search caught an old friend of Chengdu e-sports enthusiasts - Ukrainian Interstellar veteran White-Ra, and asked him to talk about his views on Chengdu and this WCG competition. It is no exaggeration to say that White-Ra is an old friend of the people of Chengdu. He has been to Chengdu many times, and he has a good understanding of many places in Chengdu: `The food in Chengdu is delicious and the best in China. . It's spicy, which I love. `Besides her love of Chengdu's food, White-Ra is also impressed by the girls in Chengdu: `They are all very beautiful! ``It turns out that a friend in Chengdu took White-Ra to sing KTV during the WCG competition, and met a few Chengdu girls by chance: 'They all sang very nicely. I love listening. ''However, White-Ra said that he is not good at singing, but can be a good listener. At the same time, White-Ra made a guess about the ranking of the WCG interstellar project: `Jaedong should be able to win the championship. ''As for himself, White-Ra said it's not a big problem to make it to the top eight and he would be very happy if he could make it to the top four. White-Ra said that he was surprised by the speed of Chinese e-sports development in recent years: 'More and more Chinese players stand out and have a high level. "At the same time, White-Ra also pointed out that China's e-sports professionalization level is not enough, and there are still many professional e-sports players like him in Ukraine.
