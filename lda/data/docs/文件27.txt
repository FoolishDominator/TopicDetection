Kobe Bryant radio interview promised Coach K: I would like to go to London to climb to the top. Sina Sports News reporter Charles de Gaulle reported that Kobe Bryant followed the US team to win the Olympic gold medal in Beijing two years ago. Recently, Kobe Bryant also publicly stated that if the national team needs, he can represent the United States team in the London Olympics two years later. Kobe is 32 years old this year, but he still maintains a very good competitive state. Previously, the US team coach Schuseski had said that he hoped Kobe Bryant can become a member of the US basketball team for the London Olympics. Kobe gave a positive response to this request from "Coach K", "If you need me to go there, I will go, and I am ready to defend my title," Kobe said on a radio program. "If you still need to score, I will do it." In fact, Kobe has always wanted to play for the national team. After the game with the Grizzlies, Kobe said: "For me, becoming the national team. It's a great honor to be a part of that." This may well be the biggest reason Kobe Bryant appeared on the court in 2012. And Kobe has already thought about his position on the court. "If I want to do anything, I want to be like Mariano Rivera and play in the last two minutes," Kobe said. Rivera, which Bryant spoke of, was an excellent baseball pitcher who currently plays for the New York Yankees. In every Yankees baseball game, he was always substituted in the last inning or two to end the game.
