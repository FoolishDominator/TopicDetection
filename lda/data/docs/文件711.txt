The first support below the lcc is about 4.5 blocks. If the stock index breaks 8000, I doubt the effectiveness of this support.

(2009-02-02 14:50:31) Expert [Zeng Wenjun] Answer: Crude oil has rebounded steadily recently, but the rebound space is unpredictable. Although in the long run, there is no problem with the current price, but it has not yet reached a stable bottom. A repeated oscillation is also required. So if you plan to make long-term investments, you can step in. If you are looking forward to a rebound in the next 1 or 2 months, you don't have to participate.

(2009-02-02 14:51:22) Expert [Zeng Wenjun] Answer: The performance of Chinese enterprises has not fully reflected the spread of the crisis. The scope and extent of the spread of the economic crisis in the United States continues, and I don't think any country can be completely immune to it. There is really nothing wrong with the business of the company itself. But now is not the time to intervene, you can continue to wait and hope that there will be operational opportunities in a few months.

(2009-02-02 14:51:57) Expert [Zeng Wenjun] A: The support of US stocks at 8000 has been repeated during the festival, but I am still not optimistic that it can be effectively supported. Therefore, it is recommended to avoid individual stocks.

Can I continue to hold it? thank you. (2009-02-02 15:48:06) Expert [Zeng Wenjun] A: The pressure of 002155 is 10 yuan, and the pressure of 002008 is 7 yuan and 5 yuan. At present, it can be held. If it reaches these two pressure levels, it is recommended to be out. The hype of the small and medium-sized board is very powerful, but it is always a financial hype, and it is difficult to judge the continuity of the intensity.

You said you wanted me to come out, but it rose to 9 yuan today. It seems that this stock will keep going up. From the current point of view, whether there is any adjustment, and what position will it be adjusted to? Thank you (2009-02-02 20:11:05) Expert [Zeng Wenjun] Answer: The short-term hot money has recently The hype is indeed very fierce, and individual stocks even exceed the price of 6,000 points. As a leader in the entrepreneurial sector, Volkswagen Public is also very prominent. However, for this kind of speculation stock, you can do one trade every time it rebounds, and you can wait for the direction of the broader market to be decided before making an operation.
