Seeking the Prophet: How much is the highest study abroad scholarship? Keio University in Japan launched a scholarship for master's students and other international students this spring, ranging from 6.3 million yen (about 63,000 US dollars) to 9 million yen (90,000 US dollars). According to the school, this is the highest level of scholarship in Japan. Kyodo News reported that the scholarship will be awarded for a period of two years. The winning students will be exempted from tuition fees such as admission fees and class fees, and will also receive 200,000 yen ($2,000) in living expenses per month. Keio University said that about 5 international students can receive this scholarship every year, and in 2008, 3 Chinese students have been confirmed to receive the scholarship. The report said that, unlike the scholarships for Japanese students, this scholarship is only based on the performance and academic performance of the international students in school, and does not refer to the family income of the international students. The school hopes to attract outstanding international students from all over the world.
