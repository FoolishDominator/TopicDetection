4,300 years ago, the world's oldest iron sword may have been cast from meteorite iron. Xinhuanet, Tokyo, September 7 (Xinhua) The iron sword was probably made of meteorite iron. The research results will be released at the Japan Analytical Chemistry Annual Meeting starting on the 10th. The iron sword was found in an ancient tomb 200 kilometers east of Ankara, Turkey, in 1938, and is about 4,300 years old, according to a report by Jiji News Agency on the 6th. It is generally believed that the technology of iron smelting at that time did not reach such a high level. Some people therefore believe that it was made of meteorite iron, but there has been no conclusive scientific basis. As a precious cultural relic in Turkey, iron swords are difficult to be loaned out. scientific research. Professor Izumi Nakai from Tokyo University of Science, Japan, in collaboration with a manufacturer of scientific analytical instruments in Osaka, has developed a sophisticated fluorescent X-ray analyzer capable of determining the chemical elements contained in irradiated objects. This small instrument can be brought into museums or archaeological sites around the world for use. The researchers then used the instrument to analyze the iron sword at the Museum of Civilizations of Peninsular Asia Minor in Ankara. The results show that in addition to iron, the sword body also contains about 7% nickel, which is in line with the typical characteristics of meteorite iron, and some other trace elements contained in the iron sword are also very similar to meteorite iron. The sword is made of meteorite iron. Meteorite is a kind of meteorite, also called iron meteorite. The main components are iron and nickel, of which iron is the main component.
