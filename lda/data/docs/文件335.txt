The decline in Beijing office rents narrowed in the third quarter, and the effective rent in Beijing's Grade A office market fell to 148.4 yuan per square meter per month in the third quarter, down 1.8% from the previous quarter, an improvement from the 5.7% decline in the previous quarter. According to the Savills research report, by region, the rent of Grade A office buildings in Beijing CBD and surrounding areas, Yansha, East Second Ring Road and East Chang'an Avenue fell by 3.0%, while the financial street and Zhongguancun areas remained stable. . In July-September, four office projects in Beijing entered the market, bringing 225,500 square meters of new supply to the market, bringing the supply in the first three quarters of 2009 to 1,030,000 square meters. Economic growth spurred a recovery in demand, with market take-up jumping 83% MoM to 170,000 sqm. At the same time, the average market vacancy rate increased slightly by 0.1 percentage points to 21.9%, and the market vacancy rate in the East Second Ring Road region rose to 34.2%. In the third quarter, the average rent on the ground floor of shopping centers increased by 1.9% to 739.3 yuan per square meter per month. The average vacancy rate fell slightly by 0.1 percentage points month-on-month to 16.8%. Meanwhile, rents in the Grade A condominium and luxury villa markets rose 1.2% and 0.6% q-o-q respectively, while rents for serviced apartments fell further by 1.6%. Occupancy rates increased in all three segments, with average occupancy rates in the serviced apartment, grade-A apartment and high-end villa markets rising by 4.8, 2.2 and 0.3 percentage points, respectively, as lower rents attracted some tenants, while serviced apartments increased by 4.8, 2.2 and 0.3 percentage points respectively. Net take-up of condos rose to 302 units during the quarter. According to Wang Qiong of Savills Research and Consulting Department, it is expected that in the fourth quarter, the rent of high-quality shopping centers in Beijing will be reduced by about 5%, and will remain stable in 2010; while the vacancy rate will remain at 15% to 15% between 20%. Occupancy rates in the high-end residential market are expected to remain stable over the next six months. However, due to the limited number of high-quality rental projects in the market, the rents of Grade A apartments and high-end villas are expected to keep rising. I would like to comment that the effective rent of Beijing's Grade A office market was lowered to 148.4 yuan per square meter per month in the third quarter, down 1.8% from the previous quarter, an improvement from the 5.7% decline in the previous quarter.
