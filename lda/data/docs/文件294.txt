Interpretation of the profit and loss index: Hertha home tie-proof betting company has supported Manchester United's current profit and loss index, going to two extremes, and there are many games that can be played with courage and difficulty. Manchester United VS Bolton, Arsenal VS Hull City, Hamburg VS Borussia have a few ultra-low home wins and losses. Needless to say, I am optimistic about the home win. Needless to say, Stoke VS Chelsea, and the guest win profit and loss index is below -20. Confidence in Chelsea's away win. Bochum VS Lever, the odds are mostly two-three-two or three-three-two combinations, there is no obvious trend, but the profit and loss indexes of several companies are both positive and negative. Lever's guest win looks very certain, which is also in line with the current trend of the loss of guest wins. For a few games with a win-loss ratio of 1.50-1.60, the profit and loss index believes that the single-choice low-loss party is unstable, and a draw in the by-election is better. Villa VS Sunderland is the best example. The profit and loss indexes of several companies are all negative and positive. SSP wins and losses and draws are close to each other. The probability of both playing is not small; In the field, facing the relegation favorite Kotteb, Hertha did not have a full grasp of winning, and the profit and loss indexes of several companies were also negative and positive, and a football lottery draw was indispensable. Bremen VS Hoffenhai one, pay special attention. The main win is around 1.40, but the SSP's profit and loss index is in the form of negative positive and negative. Although the STS company's guest win profit and loss is positive, it is not high. Once Bremen loses at home, the football lottery needs to prevent the guest win. It is also consistent with the characteristics of the two teams' record.
