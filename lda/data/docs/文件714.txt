On February 13th, the US stock market expert Tang Shi was a guest on Sina Finance and answered the questions raised by Sina netizens about the stock market. Jedi rebounded, A-shares rose strongly to 2320 today, can you tell us whether A-shares can continue to rebound next week, and where this round of rebound will probably be? Like last year's decline, everyone said it would rebound, but it did not rebound, the market volume was so large, it was like a wash, is the stock index futures going to be launched? 2009-02-13 21:14:45) Expert [Tang Shi ] Answer: The current volume and energy of the market is still magnifying. The most important thing is that PetroChina has stabilized at the 120-day moving average. Today, it has become the driving force for the market. There are similarities. Such rises tend not to value value but to increase inertia. From today, the inertia is still strong, so at least next week's situation? 2009-02-13 21:14:45) Netizen [anonymous] asked: Hello, Mr. Help me take a look at 600805, the market has been up for many days and it has not risen. It has been trending sideways. I am impatient. Will this stock improve next week? If the market adjusts, this stock will outperform the market. In addition, what is the situation after 000155, please give pointers to the teacher in your busy schedule, thank you very much. (2009-02-13 21:15:09) Expert [Tang Shi] A: The stock itself started from 2.9 yuan after the holiday, and there is a process of rapid rise. The current price above 4.5 yuan has once again got rid of short-term adjustments and hit a new high today. However, the high point of 4.7 shown by the longer shadow line today will form short-term pressure (2009-02-13 21:15:09) Netizen [anonymous] asked: Hello Mr. Tang, the cost of China Shenhua is 40 yuan, may I ask Can you top up now? thank you very much! (2009-02-13 21:22:56) Expert [Tang Shi] Answer: The price gap between the cost of 40 yuan and the current price of more than 20 yuan is indeed quite large. From the end of October last year to the end of January this year, a triple bottom has been formed. After the state festival, the heavy volume breakthrough is calculated from the shape and the price of the next challenge is 24 yuan (2009-02-13 21:22:56) Netizen [anonymous] asked: Teacher: Hello! Ask the support and pressure levels of 600963? Can I still hold it? Thank you! (2009-02-13 21:26:49) Expert [Tang Shi] A: On Thursday, even though there was an adjustment of as much as 67 points in the early trading of the broader market, there were still 748 stocks that accounted for 48% of the market and rebounded in the end. It is even more so today when it hits a new high. The stock has also hit a new high today and can record a new high. This shows the strength of the short-term. The current share price has reached the price of last year’s 919 rescue, but the stock’s trading volume was not large at that time, so I personally think that the real important pressure is 9. Up and down 2 yuan (2009-02-13 21:26:49) Netizen [anonymous] asked: Hello Mr. Tang! Please give me some guidance during your busy schedule: Where is the short-term pressure level and support level of 600117? How about the market outlook? Thank you very much! (2009- 02-13 21:27:15) Expert [Tang Shi] Answer: The stock started to increase in a straight line at 2:50 pm. If the trading volume today can still maintain the target of 8 yuan for the market, it may be possible. Reaching the support line, you can see that the 5-day moving average is the support on the 5-day antenna these two days (2009-02-13 21:27:15) Netizen [anonymous] asked: Mr. Tang: Please answer! I sold out the stock today, and I didn't expect it to pass 2,300 points before the close, very easy! Everyone is optimistic now! Looks like I was wrong! Teacher, how is the market going next week? How should it be done? You are optimistic about those sectors (or individual stocks)! Thanks! (2009-02-13 20:09:36) I want to answer (2009-02-13 21:27:20) Expert [Tang Shi] Answer: Oh, actually I was wrong, I went to Chang Shangying this Wednesday At that time, I reduced my position to only 20%. On Thursday morning, I was still happy. I bounced up in the afternoon, and I thought it was the end of the fight, but I was able to rush up strongly in the morning session. I knew that my judgment was wrong. I increased my position in the afternoon session and bought it back . . . This is the market (2009-02-13 21:27:20) Netizen [anonymous] asked: Hello Mr. Tang, can 600123 be held? Why do coal stocks always fall, is it bearish? Can coal stocks be held in the medium and long term? (2009-02-13 (2009-02-13 21:27:25) Expert [Tang Shi] Answer: All funds in the coal mining sector released from the end of January in the 4th quarter of last year's report data for funds are to lighten up their positions, so the historical decline The current rise is indeed very large. I think it is classified as an oversold rebound. The long-term nature of capital participation has not been reflected, so I am not very optimistic about the medium and long term for reference (2009-02-13 21:27:25) Netizen [Anonymous] ]Q: Hello teacher, thank you very much for answering my question in your busy schedule. The abnormally high turnover rate of Huitong Group 000415 is puzzling due to its reorganization expectations and the recent reduction of major shareholders. Please explain your doubts, thank you!!! (2009-02-13 21:27:43) Expert [Tang Shi] Answer: The average daily turnover of the stock in the 12 trading days reached 12%. It is indeed a large current major shareholder to reduce its holdings. If the policy limit exceeds 1%, it is necessary to pass through the block trading platform, so the endogenous reasons for such a large transaction volume, so the endogenous reasons for the large change of hands, have to be carefully examined, but now I think it is still possible to hold shares (2009-02-13 21:27:43) Netizen [anonymous] asked: Hello Mr. Tang, please help me to see what price 000975 can be adjusted to at the lowest level if it is adjusted next? ) Expert [Tang Shi] Answer: Today is still the same as yesterday. I will answer the questions in the order I can see. I will answer as many as possible. Look at Science City with a scary name, but 90% of its main business is cement manufacturing. The cement sector is a strong sector. Today hit a new high. According to personal estimates, the next challenge is the price of 5 yuan for reference (2009-02-13 21:28:08) Netizen [anonymous] asked: Hello Mr. Tang, 600635 public public - 600635 public public ——Is the 600635 public utility over-operated?

Where can the callback be, but today it broke through 10.9, my cost of 16 yuan, please analyze it, thank you (2009-02-13 21:28:19) Expert [Tang Shi] Answer: Haha, there are many Shanghai local Disney venture capital stockbrokers, etc. I think the price of the stock is rising today based on the concept of venture capital. It has reached a new high again, but there is basically no action in the morning depending on the time-sharing line. It means that the funds involved in the operation are looking at the face of the broader market. After the market, its internal funds will actively increase and may disappear. More or follow the broader market (2009-02- 13 21:28:19) Netizen [Anonymous] asked: What will happen after 600005 (2009-02-13 21:30:09) Expert [Tang Shi] Answer: Wuhan Iron and Steel failed to break through the high point of 7 yuan a few days ago.

Do you like this stock? ? ? ? ? (2009-02-13 21:30:22) Expert [Tang Shi] A: The military concept of this stock has driven a number of military stocks. This stock is undoubtedly the leader. It needs to be vigilant technically when it walks out of the cross star today. After all, it has not Compared with the historical high price, there are also 3 gaps in the rising process of the current integer mark of 40 yuan.

Excuse me 600103 I cost 6.15. What should I do on Monday? Can I still cover the position? Please tell me its support level and pressure level? Thank you (2009-02-13 21:32:45) Expert [Tang Shi] Answer: There are several ways to control the support pressure. Use the historical range percentage method to look at important pressure and support. Take a high point of 8 yuan last year and a low point of 1.8 yuan for a 62.5% split. The position is today's highest price of 3.22 yuan. Break through this price first, let's break through this price and the next pressure At 3.75 yuan (2009-02-13 21:32:45) netizen [anonymous] asked: Hello Mr. Tang, both stocks 000036 and 000725 are relatively low, and they are both strong today.

Where is the resistance in the market outlook? Thanks! ! (2009-02-13 21:38:46) Expert [Tang Shi] Answer: The stock has nearly doubled from the lowest price. If you can answer the previous high of 14.18 yuan again, there will be pressure. This head has a large volume and needs to be digested. If it were me, I might have ended the operation of the stock and exchanged my personal opinion for reference. How many people can get the maverick big dark horse, don't you think? Teacher Tang. (2009-02-13 21:48:27) Expert [Tang Shi] Answer: Oh, today, people from the National Development and Reform Commission said that the market will reach 3410 points, which means that there will be 1000 points later. Yes, so this time I don't care about the forecast of the person from the Development and Reform Commission. First of all, let's look at the position of 245 points. Of course, all forecasts are uncertain for reference only. (2009-02-13 21:48:27) ] Question: Dear teacher, yesterday I asked the teacher Shanghai Electric 601727. Yesterday, the stock turnover rate was 30%, and it barely closed up. The teacher suggested that if it can increase by 5%, you can leave. But today, it was flat and flat, so no one left. I asked my teacher today. The turnover rate of this stock has shrunk to 18%, and the volume has shrunk drastically. I don’t know if it’s the dealer’s shipment or if it’s poised to wash the market. How should I understand it? Excuse me, I just unpacked, what should I do?

Petrochemical only changed hands today by only 0.97%, and facing the price of 9 yuan at 10.89, I am afraid that it will take some time for China Coal to perform much better It is much more likely to understand you (2009-02-13 21:53:46) Netizen [anonymous] asked: Hello teacher What do you think about the stock market outlook?
