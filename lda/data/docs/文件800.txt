But seeing that other stocks are rising, but my own is dying, it's so painful! %>_<% What should I do? I have lost 30% of my stocks. Give a suggestion, teacher! ! ! ! (2009-12-18 21:22:49) Expert [aries Gao] A: Then we should keep the same, the general upward trend of the broader market will not change, be patient, now the stop loss is not worth the gain. (2009-12-18 21:59:45) Anonymous question: Teacher A shares seem to have an accelerated downward trend recently. Look, the downtrend of the broader market is still going on. The decline of the Shenzhen Index is significantly greater than that of the Shanghai Composite Index. Small-cap stocks that have made profits in the early stage may wish to consider coming out first. The blue-chips of the large-capital market have generally not risen much, so I am not worried about the current pullback. Small-cap stocks should be careful because of their outsized gains. I am relatively optimistic in general, and the downside is expected to be limited, and 3080 is still an important support.
