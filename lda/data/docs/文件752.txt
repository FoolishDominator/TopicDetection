On August 17th, U.S. stock market experts sat in the hall. On August 17th, U.S. stock market expert Zeng Wenjun visited Sina Finance and answered the questions raised by Sina netizens about the stock market. you are. I hope that the day of your arrival will be the day when A shares stop falling and rebound! You must be very hard today, too many people feel lost. I have consulted 600589 on the blog before, and I would like to ask, my current cost is 6.55. When it falls below its additional price of 6.06, can I cover my position, if I am ready to take it for half a year? The holding period of institutional additional issuance is one year. Thank you (2009-08-17 17:30:30) Expert [Zeng Wenjun] Answer: I remember, ^_^. The speed of the fall really surprised everyone. Top-up positions should not be considered based on the additional issue price, because individuals and institutions consider different issues. This stock industry itself is okay, so I think it is feasible to take a half-year cycle. We are more waiting for the stability of the broader market when it comes to covering short positions. Follow-up blogs will continue to analyze the market, just read it often. (2009-08-17 17:30:30) Netizen [Anonymous] asked: Teacher, I don't ask about stocks, I just cheer for you. . . Your sincerity and hard work are touching. . . The brevity of your presentation and the clarity of your thinking benefit. . . Your playful language and cute expressions make you smile when you're gasping for breath. . Thank you,,,, (2009-08-17 17:59:52) Expert [Zeng Wenjun] Answer: Thank you, ^_^. The stock market goes up and down quite normally. My goal is to be cool and cool when everyone is excited, cheer up when everyone is sad, and give everyone an objective analysis. I remember at the beginning of the year, some netizens said that everyone came here to find someone to comfort them. It was so cold that it was boring to analyze and analyze. I said at the time that it's good for everyone to comfort and comfort when it's cold. ^_^(2009-08-17 17:59:52) Netizen [Anonymous] asked: Hello, Mr. Zeng! Please analyze how DYN and LSI operate, thank you (2009-08-17 19:37:37) Expert [Zeng Wenjun] Answer: DYN previously announced the debt-to-equity swap plan, which rose 15% in one day, and then began to flatten. In the energy category, due to the instability of oil prices and the fact that US stocks have been unable to rise, it is recommended to be cautious. LSI is technically consistent with the broader market, so look at the broader market. For now, it is better to be cautious. (2009-08-17 19:37:37) Netizen [Anonymous] asked: Hello, Mr. Zeng! Please analyze the pressure points and support levels of HL and ALU, thank you! (2009-08-17 19:39:10) Expert [Zeng Wenjun] A: The trend of the US dollar is not yet clear, and I have not been very optimistic about gold. So HL does not do too much analysis. ALU Lucent, 3 is a better support. The worry now lies in the broader market of U.S. stocks, which has been unable to break through. Instead, it has fallen sharply several times during the session, and there seem to be signs of instability. So be cautious. (2009-08-17 19:39:10) Netizen [Anonymous] asked: Hello, Mr. Zeng! I'm glad to see you sitting in the hall! Where is the short-term support and pressure level of 600547? Thank you very much! (2009-08-17 19:53:08) Expert [Zeng Wenjun] A: Here is a unified talk about gold stocks. Since I am not optimistic about the price of gold, I also pay less attention to gold stocks. However, the domestic CICC Gold and Shandong Gold cannot analyze the specific support and pressure because they are controlled by the main force. So the gold stocks can't help everyone. (2009-08-17 19:53:08) Netizen [Anonymous] asked: Hello, Mr. Zeng! You haven't been here for more than a month, I miss you so much! 000939 (cost 10.63 yuan) resumed trading today, and the price limit has not been sold. What is the short-term support and pressure level? Thank you very much! (2009-08-17 20:12:02) Expert [Zeng Wenjun] A: This is a typical example of the main players using additional issues. After clarification, the limit down, support and pressure are meaningless. Just wait until it opens. (2009-08-17 20:12:02) Netizen [Anonymous] asked: Dear Mr. Zeng, good evening: Can the price of 600,019 be around 7 yuan for a rebound? 600028 10.2 Costs Looking forward to reply! Thanks! ! (2009-08-17 20:34:34) Expert [Zeng Wenjun] A: The rebound can be operated, but not now. Stay tuned. I don't think this wave of economic recovery is over, it's currently a mid-term adjustment due to liquidity draining. So as a long-term hold I agree. (2009-08-17 20:34:34) Netizen [Anonymous] asked: ~~~~~~ Home, ask for advice at a critical moment! !!600357 has the concept of reorganization, but the recent decline has been huge, and there have been frequent changes, whether it should be cut out, thank you! !!(2009-08-17 20:52:48) Expert [Zeng Wenjun] Answer: The decline has already been large, and it is not too recommended to cut meat at the current price. And the stock has not risen much, and the industry valuation is not very high. As the economic recovery process continues, it is recommended to hold first. (2009-08-17 20:52:48) Netizen [anonymous] asked: Mr. Zeng, the cost of holding YGE is 13.5, is it to cover the short position during the shock? Or out? What are the pressure points and supports? Thank you so much, looking forward to it. (2009-08-17 20:55:44) Expert [Zeng Wenjun] A: V new energy stocks have serious problems, facing the pressure of lower US stocks and oil prices. I suggest you think carefully about whether you want to be out first. It must be too early to fill up now. 10 is a small support, but I don't know if it can hold up, and it is about 7.5 below. (2009-08-17 20:55:44) Netizen [anonymous] asked: Mr. Zeng, hello! Should I hold the U.S. stocks in my hand now for a pullback or wait and see? Thanks! ! (2009-08-17 21:11:24) Expert [Zeng Wenjun] A: The US stock market has been at the 9400 platform, and has just begun to plummet. If it falls below this platform, I am afraid there is still some room below, so it is safe to fall into the pocket. is a good choice. (2009-08-17 21:11:24) Netizen [Anonymous] asked: Brother Wenjun, how to develop in the future of CNB (2009-08-17 21:12:43) Expert [Zeng Wenjun] Answer: Stocks below 1 yuan , the random fluctuation is too large, it is not recommended to participate. I haven't paid much attention, so I can't help you. (2009-08-17 21:12:43) Netizen [Anonymous] asked: Zeng sir, it is estimated that the US stock market, like China's, has plunged again today. What do you think (2009-08-17 21:16:02) Expert [Zeng Wenjun] Answer: The fact is that it has indeed plummeted. Since the 9400 point cannot be broken through repeatedly for two weeks, coupled with the continuous slump of A shares, it will still have an impact. It was also mentioned in the blog in the afternoon that it is better to wait and see cautiously in US stocks. (2009-08-17 21:16:02) Netizen [anonymous] asked: Zeng Lao?: How to operate aa and ndaq? ?(2009-08-17 21:16:53) Expert [Zeng Wenjun] A: As we have been concerned about the strengthening of the US dollar, we are not optimistic about commodity prices. So AA is no longer recommended to hold. NDAQ can wait for the U.S. stock market to stabilize after this round of decline, and then consider the issue of intervention. (2009-08-17 21:16:53) Netizen [Anonymous] asked: The US economy has bottomed out, C can intervene at the current price, can the midline hold it? (2009-08-17 21:17:01) Expert [Zeng Wenjun] Answer: The current price is definitely not suitable for direct intervention. When the U.S. stock market reached 8100 a month ago, it was recommended to buy. Just wait now. (2009-08-17 21:17:01) Netizen [anonymous] asked: Mr. Zeng made up his mind when he saw you. May I ask how to operate Zhongcai International's quilt cover with 10% full position? Does this stock have long-term investment value? (2009 -08-17 21:17:14) Expert [Zeng Wenjun] A: The stock price is near the historical high after the resumption of rights, and it is a leading enterprise in engineering construction. It is not recommended to hold the stock for the long term. Especially if it just dropped a big Yinxian. (2009-08-17 21:17:14) Netizen [Anonymous] asked: Mr. Zeng, hello! 601668 was never sold on the day it was listed. Is it necessary to hold it in the short term? How much can you estimate? Thanks! ! ! (2009-08-17 21:23:37) Expert [Zeng Wenjun] A: New stocks keep making new lows, so technical analysis is impossible. We can only wait for the market to stabilize. (2009-08-17 21:23:37) Netizen [Anonymous] asked: Hello Wenjun, how are you doing? Help analyze AA, my cost is 13.6! Is it possible to unpack it soon? How does YGE work? Can it be added now? Thank you for your patient guidance! (2009-08-17 21:25:30) Expert [Zeng Wenjun] A: I am afraid it will be difficult. Both of these stocks have been analyzed before, please refer to them. (2009-08-17 21:25:30) Netizen [Anonymous] asked: Hello, Mr. Zeng! Please analyze how AAI and GRO operate, thank you (2009-08-17 21:26:15) Expert [Zeng Wenjun] Answer: One aviation stock and one agricultural stock. If not, wait and see, and if there is, you should consider putting your money in the pocket and wait for the U.S. stock market trend to become clear before making operations. (2009-08-17 21:26:15) Netizen [Anonymous] asked: Brother Zeng, is the long-term trend of BAC still bullish? May I ask at what price can I buy it? Thanks! (2009-08-17 21:29:05) Expert [Zeng Wenjun] A: It depends on how long it is in the long run, and yes it is from the perspective of years. At present, it is better to wait for the market to stabilize before talking about buying. (2009-08-17 21:29:05) Netizen [Anonymous] asked: Boss, if I want to kill you, I want to hear the boss analyze the market and analyze the trend Thank you, boss, I want to kill you, I want to hear the boss analyze the market Analyze the trend thank you boss I want to hear it when I miss Thank you boss I want to hear the trend when I miss you Boss Analysis (2009-08-17 21:30:22) Expert [Zeng Wenjun] Answer: There are blogs every day, ^_^. http://blog.sina.com.cn/s/blog_5f47a4e70100f9c8.html?tj=1(2009-08-17 21:30:22) Netizen [anonymous] asked: Teacher, may I ask m,c,aig,cit, How about yge, fuqi and ldk?
