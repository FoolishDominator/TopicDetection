Study Abroad Guide: Don’t “Look at the Literary” in the choice of majors In the process of studying abroad, sometimes there will be such a problem: two major names that are the same or very close represent two majors with obvious differences in domestic and foreign universities. This is because there is a certain gap between Chinese and Western higher education, and there is no uniform standard for the translation of foreign university majors, and sometimes it is only a temporary translation of the name of the admissions representative. At this time, the translation of the name is prone to deviation after the applicant's secondary understanding. Therefore, when choosing a major for studying abroad, it is very necessary to confirm the name and connotation of the major. The Chinese major name of a foreign institution is an important reference when choosing a major for studying abroad, but you must know that only its original name can represent the true meaning of the major. Therefore, regardless of English, Japanese, Korean or French, students should understand the meaning of the major according to the original name when they finally determine the major. If you want to avoid taking the literal meaning, you can also do it by understanding the relevant courses of the major. Experts in studying abroad said: "The courses covered by a major can fully explain the training objectives of this major. In fact, it is more practical and reference value than the professional name." By understanding the courses covered by a particular major, students can avoid to the greatest extent possible. Choose the wrong major. It is understood that there will be detailed information on majors and courses on the websites of general colleges and universities. If not, students can also send emails directly to the school to obtain relevant information.
