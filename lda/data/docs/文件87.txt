Jackson was fined 50,000 for verbally abusing the referee or the captain was furious Sina Sports News Beijing time on November 7th, according to insidehoops, Bobcats player Stephen Jackson was fined $50,000 for allegedly verbally abusing the referee. NBA executive vice president Stu Jackson today publicly announced the penalty today. The Bobcats lost to the Pistons 90-97 on the road yesterday, giving their opponent their first win of the season. After the game, Jackson made a rude remark to the referee, but the specific content of the abuse is unknown. Because in the offseason, the league has made changes to the penalty rules, especially the penalty for technical fouls is stricter. At present, the regular season has only been going on for a long time, and many players have been late for technical fouls. This modification was frequently criticized in private, but the dissatisfaction of the players could not be clearly stated, otherwise the result may not be as simple as a fine of 2,000 US dollars, Captain Jack is an example. The revision of the rules completely gives the power of law enforcement to the referee, but it is also easy to cause wrongful convictions. One of the most controversial examples is that in the Hornets' away game against the Rockets, David West's cries of celebration for a successful attack were called a technical foul by the referee.
