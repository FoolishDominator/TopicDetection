MySpace founder and Hilton mysterious date And CEO Chris DeWolfe has been dating Paris Hilton in recent weeks. Hilton is the heir to the Hilton Group and is only 27 years old this year, while DeWolfe is 42 years old this year. Last month, the two were seen getting very close in a video. But it was recently confirmed that the two had indeed been dating in recent weeks, most recently on Friday. Whether this is MySpace's marketing tactic or whether the two really love each other is unclear, but what can be confirmed is that the two are indeed dating. But the current situation is that DeWolf already has a wife, but is rumored to have separated. Hilton also has an official boyfriend, but this is Hollywood after all. (Li Ming)
