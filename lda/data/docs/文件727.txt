On March 25, U.S. stock market experts sat in the hall. On March 25, U.S. stock expert Zeng Wenjun visited Sina Finance and answered the questions raised by Sina netizens about the stock market. Will it face a callback, should I continue to hold it or take profit first? Thank you for your advice (2009-03-25 12:24:18) Expert [Zeng Wenjun] A: You should be asking about US stocks. Commodity stocks do have a callback requirement, but I still think they can continue to hold them. (2009-03-25 12:24:18) Netizen [Anonymous] asked: Teacher, DRYS has more than 30 million shares, but the daily trading volume is more than 10 million shares. Teacher, what do you think of this phenomenon? (2009-03-25 12:32:39) Expert [Zeng Wenjun] A: The long-short game is very powerful, and DRYS often goes up and down, so it is really difficult to operate. It can only be said that not chasing high is a relatively appropriate choice. (2009-03-25 12:32:39) Netizen [Anonymous] asked: Teacher Zeng is young, and his analytical skills are really deep! Excuse me, what should I do now if I miss this wave of the US stock market? Are you waiting for a callback? (2009-03-25 12:37:50) Expert [Zeng Wenjun] A: If you miss it, just wait. Now is not the time to wait for callbacks to step in. Instead, consider whether the U.S. stock market can sustain if it reaches 8,000 points. (2009-03-25 12:37:50) Netizen [Anonymous] asked: Hello Zeng Lao,,,I'm finally here,,,I want to ask if I can enter the lvs,,,Now it's more than 3 yuan... (2009-03-25 13:12:47) Expert [Zeng Wenjun] A: Do not enter. Wait for the new round of development of the Dow to become clear. (2009-03-25 13:12:47) Netizen [Anonymous] asked: Help,,,,Old Zeng,,,Can I try to buy airline stocks now,,,Can you recommend one for me,,,, Can bwld do more (2009-03-25 13:14:31) Expert [Zeng Wenjun] Answer: Crude oil keeps rising, but the economy shows no signs of improvement. Airline stocks are not in a hurry to buy. The trend is likely to be weaker than the broader market. (2009-03-25 13:14:31) Netizen [anonymous] asked: Hello teacher! I don't know if you can see and answer the question I asked for the first time. I just want to ask your opinion on the short-term trend of ESEA. I hold the price at 4.22. Warehouse out thank you! (2009-03-25 14:26:31) Expert [Zeng Wenjun] A: With the slow recovery of the commodity market recently, shipping is also expected to gradually recover. ESEA has been in a long-term sideways state, and your price can continue to hold, keeping an eye on fundamental information. (2009-03-25 14:26:31) Netizen [Anonymous] asked: Hello, teacher, I just started to buy US stocks, I would like to ask, the US is now printing a lot of US dollars, will it have any impact on buying it now? Please give advice, thank you (2009-03-25 16:33:24) Expert [Zeng Wenjun] Answer: The dollar issue and the US stock market are not necessarily directly related. Just don't rush it now. You can pay more attention to familiarize yourself with U.S. stocks for a while. There is a good opportunity to participate slowly. Don't worry. (2009-03-25 16:33:24) Netizen [Anonymous] asked: Brother Zeng, I am also a first-generation shareholder. I entered the market in 1991. Your operation is stable and accurate, but also ruthless, emphasizing the trend, grasping the hot spots, and grasping the leader. The most commendable thing is your dedication and honesty. Young, admire, admire. This afternoon Shigekura intervened in 600348, please help analyze it. Thank you very much.-----an English teacher (2009-03-25 17:42:17) Expert [Zeng Wenjun] A: It is an honor to be recognized by your first-generation shareholders. Let's communicate together. 600348 is pretty good. I agree with your intervention time, but I don't dare to intervene at once, hehe. The results of today's international coal price negotiations do not know whether there will be some suppression in the short term. But the general direction should be no problem. (2009-03-25 17:42:17) Netizen [anonymous] asked: Xiao Zeng and aig, do you think some of them have gone up? Can you reply to $49 within 2 years? Thank you (2009-03-25 17:47:24) Expert [Zeng Wenjun] A: Ah, I don't think it's possible to return to $49. It should be expected to recover slowly without going bankrupt, but such a high price is still unimaginable. (2009-03-25 17:47:24) Netizen [anonymous] asked: Mr. Zeng, do you think Orchid Science and Technology is still in the market? Can I sell Chalco to buy Orchid Science and Technology. I have been waiting for you here for a long time, I hope you can answer me. (2009-03-25 20:09:06) Expert [Zeng Wenjun] Answer: I don't think it is necessary, and China Aluminum is also quite good. It doesn't mean too much to sell coal after it has fallen for two or three days. (2009-03-25 20:09:06) Netizen [Anonymous] asked: Mr. Zeng, analyze 600795 Guodian Power, which is currently losing 2%, can this stock still be held? Thanks! ! ! (2009-03-25 21:06:05) Expert [Zeng Wenjun] A: You can also hold it. The 6-piece support should have good strength. (2009-03-25 21:06:05) Netizen [Anonymous] asked: Is the account I opened in sogotrade safe? thanks. (2009-03-25 21:14:52) Expert [Zeng Wenjun] Answer: If it is a regular regulated company, there will be no problem. (2009-03-25 21:14:52) Netizen [Anonymous] asked: Handsome guy, asked for three nights in a row, I hope you can answer the cost of .600058.18 today, whether you want to pay. 600841.12.3 cost, how to operate, the warehouse is full now. (2009-03-25 21:14:57) Expert [Zeng Wenjun] Answer: Your intervention price is good, so I think you can continue to hold it and look forward to the follow-up space. Especially 600058, even if the market fails, it will still retain profits. The broader market short-term support 2000-2250. Today's State Council meeting news may also start an upward stimulus to the broader market tomorrow. We can observe the development of the market tomorrow. (2009-03-25 21:14:57) Netizen [anonymous] asked: Hello Mr. Xiao Zeng! Help look at the trend of 000009 and 000926! These 2 stocks fell quite sharply today! Do you want to run? Thanks! (2009-03-25 21:15:13) Expert [Zeng Wenjun] A: The trend of these two stocks is basically the same, and the fundamentals are not outstanding. There shouldn't be any big chances in the future. The main force should be for the purpose of shipping. The decline in the past two days is expected, and there is no need to sell and run. Can be held temporarily, looking forward to the opportunity of the market to continue to go up. Don't hold these two stocks for a long time. (2009-03-25 21:15:13) Netizen [Anonymous] asked: Mr. Zeng, aviation stocks seem to be on the rise. Do you think I feel right? Is there a chance for him to invest in the long-term now? (2009-03-25 21:17:23) Expert [Zeng Wenjun] A: Aviation stocks can only be said to be compensating for the market. Long-term investing isn't necessarily a good opportunity for airline stocks right now. Some of the previous analysis, you can refer to. (2009-03-25 21:17:23) Netizen [Anonymous] asked: Zeng, why is the trend of 601766 CSR and 601390 China Railway so strange? Where are the pressure and support positions? In the end, is there a drama for the railway stocks in the later stage? (2009-03-25 21:18:53) Expert [Zeng Wenjun] A: During this period of time, railway stocks have been like this. Been sideways. In the later stage, I believe that there is still drama, at least the company is good, and the performance will be better than 60% of the stocks in the long run. Pressure and support are the upper and lower edges of a sideways move. (2009-03-25 21:18:53) Netizen [Anonymous] asked: Teacher: Maotai's good performance and dividends have brought about a big drop. I really don't know whether to go or stay? Are there still A shares worth investing in? (2009-03-25 21:20:30) Expert [Zeng Wenjun] A: I think Maotai is not worth holding for a long time. With the strengthening of government self-discipline, I am not optimistic about Maotai, which relies on government consumption. There are many worth investing in, we need to explore slowly. (2009-03-25 21:20:30) Netizen [Anonymous] asked: Hello teacher Zeng! Is today's A-share market a normal adjustment? Thanks! (2009-03-25 21:24:49) Expert [Zeng Wenjun] Answer: ? Normal, as expected. A drop to 2200 is expected to be acceptable. (2009-03-25 21:24:49) Netizen [Anonymous] asked: Excuse me, handsome Zeng, is the colored market over? (2009-03-25 21:26:19) Expert [Zeng Wenjun] A: Letâ€™s talk about it by the way Talk about colored. You can refer to the resource stocks in your hands. It was said on Monday that there will be an oscillating market in the resource category in the next few days. Yesterday, the resources category fell in late trading, coupled with the decline in overseas resources last night, but today's trend is stronger than I expected. I don't think the market is over yet, and there is a chance for a sharp drop to intervene, but don't chase the highs. (2009-03-25 21:26:19) Netizen [Anonymous] asked: Hello Big Brother Zeng, I entered 002003 at a low intraday level today, but it is still a small set. The news at night said that textiles will increase export tax rebates. Do you want to come out first? (2009-03-25 21:26:56) Expert [Zeng Wenjun] A: It still depends on the market's reaction to the news tomorrow before deciding the next step. (2009-03-25 21:26:56) Netizen [Anonymous] asked: The key point is that I don't know if sogotrade is a regular regulated company. Do you think he is a legitimate regulated company? thanks. (2009-03-25 21:36:10) Expert [Zeng Wenjun] Answer: I don't know this company, so I dare not make an assertion. You can check the relevant agency website. Very convenient. (2009-03-25 21:36:10) Netizen [Anonymous] asked: how to learn day trading about index 500? (2009-03-25 21:36:54) Expert [Zeng Wenjun] A: This, intraday trading It depends on the familiarity and sense of the market. I won't either, I can't help you, ha ha. (2009-03-25 21:36:54) Netizen [anonymous] asked: Mr. Zeng, hello! I'm so glad you're here again. I adore you so much! At present, I have a short position. I remember last time you said that you are not optimistic about the A-share market, it will plummet! The stock market has begun to pull back today. Do you think it will be adjusted to below 1800 or even around 1600 in the near future? I want to buy 000515. The cash option will be implemented at the end of the month or the beginning of next month. I don't dare to enter and I'm afraid of losing the opportunity. Could you please give me some advice? If so? (2009-03-25 21:40:10) Expert [Zeng Wenjun] A: Thank you. But I didn't say it was going to drop a lot last time. Today's callback is also expected, to say 1800 or even 1600 is too long. 000515 There is no room for cash options, why would you want to enter? (2009-03-25 21:40:10) Netizen [anonymous] asked: Mr. Zeng: 000798 went bad today, and it didn't go very well. The cost of 6 yuan, please comment (2009-03-25 21 :43:06) Expert [Zeng Wenjun] Answer: 000798 is not a high-quality stock at all, and the negative impact has no real impact on it, it mainly depends on the flow of funds. The cost of 6 yuan, because the strong support is here, I suggest that you can continue to wait. The adjustment of the broader market is also expected. (2009-03-25 21:43:06) Netizen [anonymous] asked: I have asked n times, but I have not seen your answer. Please help me to see 600357 and 600022. Thank you (2009-03-25 21:58:08) Expert [Zeng Wenjun] A: The trend of steel stocks is quite clear, so you can hold them temporarily. Let us look at the development of the broader market on it. (2009-03-25 21:58:08) Netizen [Anonymous] asked: ******************************** **************************** Hello teacher, please analyze LDK, thank you! ! ! (2009-03-25 21:59:34) Expert [Zeng Wenjun] Answer: In the case of low oil prices, the operating pressure of solar energy companies is very large. Of course, the rising crude oil has given them life again. In particular, crude oil remains above $50 and is expected to continue to rise. So keep up with crude oil prices. There are certain trading opportunities. (2009-03-25 21:59:34)
