Yao Buxian Asian set analysis: Chelsea Roma will win Liverpool, the prospect is bleak Article source Sina Lottery Blog League 01. Chelsea VS Bordeaux Odds Statistics: Willian: 1.22/4.80/10.00, the same odds of 5 wins in similar games SSP: 1.25/4.50/ 10.00, with the same odds for 5 wins in similar games, the European real-time average odds are 1.28↓/4.62↑/10.52↑, which is equivalent to the Asian handicap. The mainstream sub-pan is semi-inflated, and the water level in the upper pan is slightly higher than theoretical. Chelsea's league has been gaining momentum recently and is currently leading the Premier League; compared to Bordeaux's poor performance in Ligue 1, it is currently only in the middle of the league. Last season’s second match in Ligue 1 in the Premier League, Chelsea’s ability to play the ball at home shows the banker’s attitude. This combination of odds is equivalent to Chelsea playing against a mid-range ball at home in the Premier League. The team has a winning rate of more than 80%, and a single 3 can win.

Rome VS Cluj odds statistics: William: 1.20/5.00/11.00, the same odds of the home team in similar competitions with 12 wins, 2 draws and 1 loss The European real-time average odds are 1.24/5.04/11.20, which is equivalent to the main handicap of Qiuban/Two Goals in the Asian handicap. The mainstream Asian handicap is mainly handicap of Qiuban low water or Qiuban/Two Goals high water. Most of the Asian handicap are too shallow. Roma had a bad start in Serie A, with only 1 draw and 1 loss; however, the Romanian champions are currently in a bad situation, ranking in the middle with 11 points from 7 games. The Asian plate opened shallowly, and it is estimated that the bookmakers considered the downturn in Rome. Although the Serie A runner-up feels that its strength has declined this season, it should be more than enough to deal with the Romanian team. Recommended: 3. 03. Panathinaikos VS Inter Milan odds statistics: SSP3.75/3.15/1.90, the same odds for the home team in similar competitions with 1 win, 1 draw and 1 loss The European real-time average odds are 3.65/3.18/1.98, which is equivalent to the Asian handicap The water is high in the hemisphere, and the mainstream Asian players make the water in the hemisphere high. Inter Milan with 1 draw and 1 loss came to Greece, and the main winning odds of major European bookmakers are controlled below 4.00, which is a very dangerous signal! It seems that Mourinho has not fully formed Inter Milan, coupled with the Greek home team has rich experience in European wars and is crazy at home, so Inter Milan may lose points. Fortunately, the situation in this group is quite favorable to Inter Milan. The only competitor is Bremen, which has a downward trend this season. Therefore, Inter Milan's away game is not a life and death battle and can accept a draw. The Asian player made the hemisphere high, and Inter Milan focused on preventing the draw in this game.

Bassoli VS Shakhtar Donetsk Odds Statistics: William: 2.30/3.10/2.75, the same odds match the home team 2 wins and 1 loss Ladbrokes: 2.20/3.20/2.80, the same odds similar match the home team 5 wins 2 draws and 3 losses. The European real-time average odds are 2.31/3.16/2.91, which is equivalent to the Asian handicap main handicap tie/hemisphere high water or the tie home team low water, and the instant Asian handicap tie to the main handicap tie/hemisphere high water. Basoli can only make a draw or a draw/half high water at home. The handicap is a little shallow. It seems that the Ukrainian league level is still a bit higher than the Swiss league. However, the home team is in good shape in the Swiss league recently, and the miners want to get 3 Dividing is not easy. Recommended: 10. 05. Barcelona VS Sporting Lisbon Odds statistics: William: 1.30/4.20/8.50, the same odds of the home team 4 wins in the same competition The odds are 1.28/4.63/9.90, which is equivalent to the Asian handicap owner making Qiuban medium-low water, and the mainstream Asian handicap handing Qiuban medium-high water to high water. The water level in the upper plate is not ideal, and the cold phase is full. The Barcelona league has not started to win, and all the pressure is concentrated on this Champions League. Lisbon is not an underdog, but the away results are relatively average. Basoli and Miners in this group are relatively weak. As long as Lisbon maintains a draw on the road and wins at home, there is a great chance of qualifying. Lisbon can take advantage of the home team's eagerness to fight back in this game, even if they win away from home, don't be surprised. Recommendation: 31, big single package, Ren Jiu gave up. 06. Eindhoven VS Atletico Odds Statistics: William: 2.40/3.10/2.60, the same odds match the home team 3 wins, 4 draws and 5 losses Ladbrokes: 2.37/3.00/2.75, the same odds match the home team 3 wins 2 draws and 1 loss. The European real-time average odds are 2.50/3.09/2.69, which is equivalent to the low water of the home team in the Asian handicap, and the low water of the home team in the mainstream Asian handicap. The strength of the four teams in this group is balanced. Marseille and Liverpool are regulars in the Champions League. Therefore, in order to qualify for the group, the first round must be won. Losing the Atletico League is likely to save for the Champions League. Since PSV did not participate in the Champions League preliminaries, it felt that the time to enter the game state was later than Atletico. When the Atletico Champions Cup preliminaries challenged Schalke away, the average payout was 2.15/3.15/3.12. Now the main win has improved a lot, and I feel that the hope of winning the Dutch champion is not very big. The average flat payout of this game is relatively high. , Customer Win should be the first choice. Recommended: 10, small single blog 0. 07. Marseille VS Liverpool odds statistics: Ladbrokes: 3.00/3.00/2.20, with the same odds, the home team has 2 wins, 2 draws and 1 loss. The European real-time average odds are 2.98/3.09/2.31. Can be strongly handled as a tie / hemisphere high water plate. Mainstream Asian players let the tie / hemisphere high water play, and the collective treatment of the Asian plate is relatively deep. Marseille is currently leading the Premier League with Chelsea and is in good shape, but Bordeaux is currently doing quite well in Ligue 1. The two sides in the Champions League last season met in the group stage. As a result, Liverpool lost 0-1 at home and beat Marseille 4-0 away to qualify. So this game Liverpool's away tie/hemisphere plate feels shallow (the average payout of the game that won the away game last season was 4.13/3.38/1.82). Liverpool are currently injured more seriously, after the weekend league reversal of Manchester United, it is doubtful whether the strength of the Champions Cup can be maintained on the road in the middle of the week. This game is cold-proof. Recommended: 31.
