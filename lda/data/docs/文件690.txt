Britain launched a concept car on ice with a maximum speed of 135 kilometers per hour (Photos) On the concept car‚Äù, it looks like it is assembled with a high-rise building toy, but it can withstand the low temperature test of minus 72 degrees Celsius. With the help of three coasters, it can reach speeds of up to 84 mph (about 135 kilometers) and is also an eco-friendly car. The innovative ice car will be used to drive across 3,000 miles of snow in Antarctica, powered by biofuels. The modified superpower BMW 1150 engine emits around 70 percent less greenhouse gases than regular gasoline. The inventor of the Ice Concept is named Kieron Bradley, a former F1 car designer. "Antarctica is one of the biggest mysteries in the world," he said. The ice car was built by Brad using components from a motorized gliding wing: "The whole process was like a big learning curve." Two explorers With the help of an ice car, we will embark on a long journey to the South Pole, which will highlight the importance of the ice cap to our planet. The ice vehicle has a radar that detects dangerous cracks under the ice. The vehicle weighs about 350 kilograms, and the occupants can manually pull the ice onto the vehicle to cross rough areas. Andrew Moon and Andrew Regan will travel with the crew of the Ice Concept Car. "If you can successfully use biofuels to power things in some of the harshest, most extreme environments in the world, then there's no reason why we shouldn't use them in supermarkets," said Regan. The adventure-loving Moon and Reagan had been to Antarctica before. and the North Pole, but this is their first attempt to cross Antarctica in the name of education. "I have six children, and I really hope that this expedition will stimulate a real interest in knowledge," Regan explained.
