U.S. trucks travel more than a million miles on the odometer back to zero A Texas truck driver drove the same vehicle over 1 million miles (1.61 million kilometers) on the 4th, causing the number on the car's odometer to return to zero. Brent Boyd, 51, has been with United Parcel Service (UPS) for 22 years. After entering the company, he has been driving the truck. Boyd said he never had an accident with the car. The truck has had 3 engines replaced and painted many times. The company offered to offer a new car, but Boyd declined. In Boyd's view, driving the truck that has accompanied him for twenty years has a "sit at home" feeling. (Xinhua)
