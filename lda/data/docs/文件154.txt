Planning: Blonde, white skin and blood--Hitchcock Blonde (Photos) As a film master with a high artistic sense of smell, Hitchcock has a unique and profound understanding of female nature and aesthetic standards. He once publicly expressed his disapproval of overly direct sexy and sensual actresses: "Poor Marilyn Monroe and Brigitte Bardot have sex on their faces at all times, which is very crude.  … Women . . . are more interesting than Italian women, and it's surprising that a stodgy English schoolgirl can make out with you in the same car." Hitchcock's ideal woman is a combination of ice and fire: He has the appearance of a peach and plum, with a reserved and cold attitude, but at the same time, he has a strong lust that is ready to erupt at any time. He relishes one detail in "To Catch a Thief": Grace Kelly, played by Francis, keeps a calm and nonchalant attitude when she first meets the hero, as glamorous and cold as a statue. But just as Robbie, played by Cary Grant, sends her back to the door, she unexpectedly turns around inside the door and places a deep kiss on Robbie's lips. Hitchcock believed that it was this category of actresses who possessed the energy of "sexual discovery", resulting in unexpected dramatic shots and good scenes. The 007 series, which drew countless inspirations from Hitchcock films, turned the Bond girl into a well-known vocabulary, but in fact Hitchcock girl literacy has a longer-lasting aesthetic appeal. As Hitchcock's birthday approaches, let's take a look back at this dazzling string of names.
