Newly discovered asteroid may help explain the origin of comets Sina Technology News Beijing time August 20 news, according to foreign media reports, researchers said on the 18th that a newly discovered asteroid orbiting a narrow orbit may help explain the origin of comets. The sun-orbiting asteroid, called 2006 SQ372, is now moving away from the sun from the outer part of a 22,500-year orbit that can reach 150 billion miles (241.4 billion kilometers). 2006 SQ372 is an icy rock that is only a little over 2 billion miles (3.2 billion kilometers) away from Earth, researchers said at a seminar held on the 18th, which is closer than Neptune. The findings will be published in The Astrophysical Journal. 2006 SQ372's elliptical orbit is four times its diameter, said study leader Andrew Becker, an astronomer at the University of Washington. The Pluto-like dwarf planet Sedna, discovered in 2003, is the only planet with a similar orbit other than 2006 SQ372. The 2006 SQ372 is about 60 miles (97 kilometers) in diameter. "It's basically a comet, but it never makes close contact with the sun and doesn't form a long bright tail of concentrated gas and dust," Baker said in the statement, said Nathan Kaib, a graduate student at the University of Washington. ) said it was unclear how 2006 SQ372 formed. "Similar to Pluto, it formed in a belt of icy debris away from Neptune, after which the gravitational pull of either Neptune or Uranus kicked it far away," he said in the statement. It is thought that 2006 SQ372 is more likely to originate from the Oort Cloud, a cloud of icy asteroid-like objects orbiting trillions of miles from the Sun. "Understanding the origin of comets is one of our goals, and comet formation is one of the most spectacular space events," he said. "Our bigger goal is to understand the early history of the solar system and what really happened when planets formed." (Xiaowen)
