Ding Mingji: Is 7000 the bottom? The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed last week at 7062.93 and once hit the lowest point since February 1998 at 7033.62, far from the low point during the Asian financial crisis in 1998. 7379.70, the low of 7197.49 after the Internet bubble in 2002, and the low of 7449.38 during the AIG incident in November last year were thrown out of the cloud. Seeing that the Dow Jones Industrial Average is about to face a severe 7,000-point defense battle next week, everyone can't help but ask, can it be held? If not, where will the lower lows be? I have observed several interesting facts about this index. First, according to past historical experience, the low point usually occurs in the month when the monthly line can close. If the index can show a positive line in March, we may temporarily see an opportunity for the index to rebound. . Second, according to the experience of more than two decades in the past, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has never fallen for more than 6 consecutive months, and the Dow has also fallen for a full 6 months from September last year to February this year. Perhaps this It can inspire the confidence and morale of the bulls to counterattack the lost ground. Third, the trading volume of the Dow Jones index this month was the largest in the history of the index, 32.66 billion shares. It exceeded 30 billion shares for the second time in October last year, and the index fell for the first time in November last year. Hopefully March volumes will shrink as the market's momentum turns more conservative, which may help the Dow bottom out. Fourth, the current position of the monthly 200EMA of the Dow Jones Industrial Average is 8683.88. In other words, the average position of the index over the past 16 years fell below October last year, which is a phenomenon that the Dow Jones has never seen in the past 20 years. . It can be explained that in the case that the absolute majority of shareholders are losses, it may be helpful for volume contraction. Fifth, judging from a number of technical indicators and the VIX oscillator index, of course, it is currently in a serious oversold zone. I believe this time will not be too long. The S&P 500 also fell below its July 2002 low of 775.68, before closing last week at 735.09. However, the Nasdaq Composite Index is still more than 200 points away from the low point of 1108.49 in October 2002, and only about 80 points away from the low point of 1295 in November. We are paying close attention to whether there will be a catch-up market. But it is conceivable that if the decline in the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index intensifies next week, it will definitely not be a good thing for the market. Thanks for watching.
