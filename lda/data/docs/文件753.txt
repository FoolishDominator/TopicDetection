On August 18th, U.S. stock experts sat in the hall. On August 18th, U.S. stock expert Zeng Wenjun visited Sina Finance and answered questions about the stock market raised by Sina netizens. I bought 600489 and 600050 at 50.3 and 7.4 respectively. Is it time to cover the position now? Thank you (2009-08-18 11:52:36) Expert [Zeng Wenjun] A: The market has not entered a stable state yet, and it takes time to observe the development of the trend. (2009-08-18 11:52:36) Netizen [Anonymous] asked: Brother, I want to ask about the forecast of the US stock market tonight. I donâ€™t know much about overseas stock markets. I prefer foreign exchange analysis, but the impact of foreign markets on the foreign exchange market. Is the analysis method of the Shanghai stock market, which is a big foreign market trend, the same? I have to come to support the market often in the future (2009-08-18 16:35:21) Expert [Zeng Wenjun] Answer: All overseas markets are closely linked. It is absolutely impossible to look at one market alone. The trend of US stocks tonight is hard to say, but the dollar is estimated to start a strong road. (2009-08-18 16:35:21) Netizen [anonymous] asked: HI! How about china?pleases. (2009-08-18 20:04:01) Expert [Zeng Wenjun] A: No one in China is on CHINA.COM now. Not worth the investment. (2009-08-18 20:04:01) Netizen [Anonymous] asked: Teacher, please analyze GE and ESLR, should you leave or stay? Thank you (2009-08-18 20:26:39) Expert [Zeng Wenjun] Answer: My overall analysis of the current market situation is: US stocks have room to fall, but the 8800 strong support, the dollar will strengthen, and crude oil will be under great downward pressure. So I tend to go ESLR. GE can figure it out for itself. (2009-08-18 20:26:39) Netizen [Anonymous] asked: Hello teacher, it seems that your presence has indeed brought a ray of sunshine to our dull and depressed market. Hi-Tech, the 16.00 book has dropped to 14.5 at present. Since the overall real estate sector is not good, I have tried to cut the meat several times today. I want to ask the teacher to help me analyze whether to leave or stay? (2009-08-18 20:35:18) Expert [Zeng Wenjun] A: The long-term trend was completely broken down yesterday, so I suggest choosing the right time. Zhangjiang Hi-Tech is not a company worthy of long-term investment. (2009-08-18 20:35:18) Netizen [anonymous] asked: Teacher, how about snda.thank you. (2009-08-18 20:48:29) Expert [Zeng Wenjun] A: Oh, I remember doing many company analysis in May and June, and I am not optimistic. At that time, the closure of WOW and the launch of Aion gave SNDA's stock price greater support, but the market response of Aion did not seem to be satisfactory, and the stock price has been sluggish since then. Now the market is also a little weak, and it is even more difficult for SNDA to perform well. (2009-08-18 20:48:29) Netizen [Anonymous] asked: Mr. Zeng, hello, can you help me analyze 600061 (2009-08-18 20:49:01) Expert [Zeng Wenjun] replied: The textile industry may have a better recovery in the second half of the year, so there should be some opportunities for textile stocks in the second half of the year. At present, it is mainly to see the development of the broader market. (2009-08-18 20:49:01) Netizen [Anonymous] asked: Teacher, help me to see what to do with my Western Mining Industry and Baotou Steel Rare Earth, do you want to cut the meat tomorrow or the day after tomorrow, urgent! ! ! (2009-08-18 20:53:16) Expert [Zeng Wenjun] Answer: I think so far, it cannot be said that this round of adjustment is over, and because I am optimistic about the strength of the US dollar, I still look at the trend of commodity resources. Bearish. (2009-08-18 20:53:16) Netizen [Anonymous] asked: Teacher, I have a heavy position in LFC, please help me analyze the trend, thank you (2009-08-18 20:56:24) Expert [Zeng Wenjun] replied: The performance of life insurance is still good, and the institutions are also relatively optimistic. After this round of market decline and stability, I think it is a variety that can be considered for intervention. (2009-08-18 20:56:24) Netizen [Anonymous] asked: Good Morning, Mr.Zeng, Could you please give me some advice about US stock, should i sold out them and wait for situation getting better or i can hold them? Thx(2009-08-18 20:56:28) Expert [Zeng Wenjun] Answer: The current US stock market is actually not stable. Although we are still optimistic in the medium term, there is still a high possibility of adjusting to 8800 points first. So you should make a decision based on your specific breed and psychological tolerance. (2009-08-18 20:56:28) Netizen [Anonymous] asked: Teacher, what should China Pacific Insurance and Haitong Securities Guoyuan Securities do? Go or stay? (2009-08-18 20:56:31) Expert [Zeng Wenjun] A: It is difficult for me to answer you now if you ask about financial stocks. First of all, I don't think the adjustment is over yet, but financial stocks have already fallen dramatically, and even if it is a mid-term adjustment, it should be approaching a rebound position. Guoyuan has been down less, and there may still be room. (2009-08-18 20:56:31) Netizen [Anonymous] asked: The second quarter quarterly report of shipping stocks is at the bottom, with a small increase in the previous period and a huge drop recently. , Such as 250 lines or so, 000520 of 5 yuan? (2009-08-18 21:08:09) Expert [Zeng Wenjun] Answer: 000520 should be classified as 8 stocks, not shipping stocks. The stock has a stronger linkage with 8 stocks than shipping stocks such as China COSCO. Let's wait and see. (2009-08-18 21:08:09) Netizen [Anonymous] asked: [[Master Zeng! Hello! ]] What do you think of colored post-production? Please guide me! Another help to look at Western Mining (601168) is extremely grateful! ! (2009-08-18 21:12:34) Expert [Zeng Wenjun] A: I have analyzed it before, check it out (2009-08-18 21:12:34) Netizen [Anonymous] asked: Mr. Zeng, hello ! NOK cost 13.33 How does it work? Cut meat or hold? Looking forward to your advice! Be sure to help with the analysis! (2009-08-18 21:17:46) Expert [Zeng Wenjun] A: The platform just gapped at 13 blocks and broke through the previous low, I am afraid it will continue the downward trend. It is recommended to keep the funds first. (2009-08-18 21:17:46) Netizen [Anonymous] asked: Hello teacher, how can I use these checks in MET MS HOT COF CCL in an ultra-short-term operation today (2009-08-18 21:20:26) Expert [Zeng Wen Jun] A: Oh, I'm not a day trader, I'm afraid I can't help you. (2009-08-18 21:20:26) Netizen [mobile phone user] asked: Hello teacher, this is my first question, can you help me analyze public transportation? Today I bought it at the limit of 12.68, please don't miss me, okay? thank you very much! ! (2009-08-18 21:27:25) Expert [Zeng Wenjun] A: The operation is too risky. This kind of money is not easy to make. (2009-08-18 21:27:25) Netizen [Anonymous] asked: Expert Zeng is good. Yesterday, against the backdrop of the sharp drop in US stocks, the flowering period opened low and went high and closed only slightly down. Combined with the strength of Citigroup during this period and the investment bank's higher rating, the target price is 5.75 yuan. I would like to ask: 1. Is this a recent market change? Is the focus of Asian capital returning to the US market due to dips? 2. Is Citi's current share price a major strategic opportunity for retail investors? (2009-08-18 21:27:45) Expert [Zeng Wenjun] Answer: This friend may be new to US stocks. The strategic opportunity for C is unquestionable. You don't have to rush to buy in the short term, just wait for the opportunity. (2009-08-18 21:27:45) Netizen [Anonymous] asked: Hello, Mr. Zeng! Is the U.S. dollar moving in the opposite direction to U.S. stocks? I feel that the current money is really not durable. It is really difficult to buy a one-storey house in a lifetime just by taking a job! I feel that the former is becoming more and more worthless, and the house price is ridiculously high. What do you think of the real estate of A shares? Feeling a bit inflationary! (2009-08-18 21:28:59) Expert [Zeng Wenjun] Answer: The US dollar has a cash hedging effect in the early stage, so it is the opposite. But it is not the norm, and there is no necessary opposite relationship between the two. The domestic real estate industry is in an overall rising period, mainly due to the strong demand caused by the urbanization process. In addition, the mentality of the Chinese people on real estate is different from that of Europe and the United States, so the housing prices are generally on the high side. It takes a long time to come back. (2009-08-18 21:28:59) Netizen [Anonymous] asked: Hello Mr. Zeng, long time no see, I hope everything is well. Excuse me, can solar stocks be held for the long term? Do you recommend opening positions in batches? I have a 4.60-in JASO and a 2.04-in ESLR, and I want to buy more, because solar energy is still very promising. But see you just suggested going ESLR. Please give your opinion, thank you very much! ! (2009-08-18 21:29:25) Expert [Zeng Wenjun] A: The solar energy industry has long-term prospects, which has been considered over the years. In the short and medium term, the pressure will be greater. And industry prospects and company prospects are not exactly the same. (2009-08-18 21:29:25) Netizen [Anonymous] asked: How does the teacher speculate in US stocks in mainland China? (2009-08-18 21:29:26) Expert [Zeng Wenjun] Answer: You can complete the account opening by contacting the US brokerage through the Internet and going through the relevant procedures. Then you can trade it online. (2009-08-18 21:29:26) Netizen [Anonymous] asked: Hello, Mr. Zeng! What is the future of SINA and PWRD, thank you! (2009-08-18 21:30:21) Expert [Zeng Wenjun] A: All were affected by the pressure of the broader market. The trend of PWRD in the past few months is very strong, you can consider tracking it more. It is recommended to wait for now. (2009-08-18 21:30:21)
