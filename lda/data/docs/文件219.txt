The amazing odds combination of the mysterious small company locked the first cold score of the football lottery in advance. Special reporter Tian Wei reported that last weekend's quiz World Cup qualifiers were unpopular, and the winning and losing lottery, the goal lottery, and the half-court did not hit the first prize. It is the first time in the history of Chinese football that all three of the first prizes are empty. The reason for all this is the following three games: Romania 0-3 Lithuania hit rate: 2.08% This is definitely the most lethal game in the last period, according to the statistics of the National Sports Lottery Center, Romania lost 0-3 at home to Lithuania, As many as 88.1% of the bets are bullish on Romania, and only a measly 2.08% are filled with "0". In addition to the absence of captain Kivu and Mutu, the absence of many overseas players due to injuries and the underestimation of the enemy were the main reasons for Romania's defeat. In terms of European compensation, it is not without signs to follow. When mainstream companies such as Ladbrokes and William have changed their positions in favor of the home team, SSP once again showed its accuracy in grasping the unpopular. Under the rate, the home team's winning rate is only 50%, which is obviously different from the 70% winning rate of the Australian set. Under this odds, the winning rate of the last game is only 20%. In addition, the author reminds you to pay attention to an Intertops company registered in Antigua and Barbuda. The company offers 1.254.509.00. From April this year to the present, in 11 games, the home team has 6 wins, 2 draws and 3 losses. The most critical What's more, the home team lost all three games with the same score of 0 to 3 (2008-04-26 Czech Republic, Slavia Prague VS Sheskoff 0 to 3, 2008-04-12 Portuguese Super League, Benphie Plus VS University of Coimbra 0 to 3). The 61 games that opened at this odds had a less than 40% win rate last time, and only 24 games. To sum up, this unpopularity is indeed not what most people can foresee. But think about it on the other hand, if you are proficient in European football, you can choose to avoid any 9 gameplay, as the "Big Winner" reminded in the newspaper last week: "Take advantage of the weakness, Lithuania may be upset." Norway 2 to 2 Iceland hit 8.8% before this game, when I made a recommendation for the big winner, I have clearly pointed out the psychological upset of defending against Norway. Let's take a look at the performance of Intertops. It offered odds of 1.354.007.00 in this game. The winning rate of the 9 games opened under this odds is also less than 40%. Moreover, the odds are based on the historical statistics of the World Cup. The home team won 7 and drew 1. The only draw was in Wales VS Northern Ireland on September 9, 2004, when the score was also 2 to 2. It can be seen that Intertops' grasp of the score is worthy of further study. The author's second reason for recommending anti-cold is to look at the performance of Norwegian local companies --- NorskTipping. In its historical statistics of the World Cup with odds of 1.353.855.70, the home team has 8 wins, 4 draws and 1 loss, and the draw accounts for 30% of the ratio. In addition to historical statistics, spot odds changes are also very important. The initial offer of Ladbrokes in this game was 1.225.0010.00 on September 1, and it was changed to 1.305.0010.00 on September 5, which was maintained until the final game. The comparison found that only the main win odds increased, and the other two The items remained unchanged until the end of the game, which was a rare change in Ladbrokes in the past, and it also directly blocked the possibility of the home team winning. Austria 3-1 France
