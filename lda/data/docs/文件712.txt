Today, with the strength of blue-chip stocks, the market easily jumped to the first half of the year, and it should be able to maintain its strength. The pressure of 895 can be slightly higher than 15. 316 is also a relatively demonic stock in history, and it may have a very explosive performance, which depends on the funds in it.

(2009-02-04 10:30:10) Expert [Zeng Wenjun] Answer: Gold has now been separated from crude oil and the US index, and has become a place for safe-haven funds in the stock market. So stocks fell and gold rose. However, the trend of gold in the past two days is a bit soft. It is recommended to wait and see first, and then look at the situation of the stock index. (2009-02-04 10:30:10) Netizen [Anonymous] asked: Boss, will the crude oil ETF USO continue to explore the previous lows? Where can I buy? Thank you (2009-02-04 10:41:08) Expert [Zeng Wenjun] Answer: I analyzed the oil price a few days ago and it is currently a weak rebound. Mainly because the economic deterioration continues, the support of oil prices is insufficient. You can continue to wait and see, there should be a chance to fall. Wait patiently, we can't talk about the price now, we will see it later. (2009-02-04 10:41:08) Netizen [Anonymous] asked: Teacher, oil prices have plummeted, why are airline stocks also weak recently? uaua, lcc, dal. Is there a chance? (2009-02-04 10:43:04) Expert [Zeng Wenjun] A: Last week, we discussed the issue of airline stocks. Because airline stocks are affected by both crude oil and the stock index, although crude oil is weaker, the stock index is even weaker. In addition, aviation stocks are all on the upper edge of the box at that time, so it is not recommended to intervene. This week, airline stocks have been running towards the lower edge of the box. If it runs to the lower edge, and the Dow can still remain at 8,000 without breaking, and then cooperate with oil prices, there will be short-term opportunities. But this all requires waiting.
