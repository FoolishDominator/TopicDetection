Garnett: Villanueva is just a nobody, so I won't pay attention to him The Charlie-Villaneuve drama is over. When KG was asked how he felt about the matter in an interview, he described the Pistons general as just an unknown person who would no longer pay attention to him. "An unknown guy," Garnett said. "I'm not going to pay attention to him." It would be incorrect to say that he really wasn't affected by it. Because the farce broke out, Garnett's two games at home were very emotional. Still, he has the support of Celtics fans. "It feels good to have fans like that." Garnett praised the fans and thanked them. "Honestly we don't have to ask for your support, but the fans go out of their way to support us every night. The truth is, every game they play. Support us, even if you play like shit or you look bad. They're always there for us no matter what. I've always said I'm not perfect, but I can always play hard." Kyle a few days ago After the match between the specials and the Pistons, Villanueva said on Weibo (http://t.sina.com.cn) that Garnett called him a cancer patient during the game. KG then explained that he meant Villanueva was a tumor for the Pistons and the league, not a deliberate insult about his alopecia. Since then, many people have also joined the war of words. (Wolfman)
