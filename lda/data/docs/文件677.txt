Beijing Science and Technology News: Study says giant squid is not Tyrannosaurus tyrannosaur . Marine biologist Steve Ohi, who led the research, said the female squid "giant" was 10 meters long and weighed more than 450 kilograms. It was an accident when fishermen caught Chilean sea bass in the Ross Sea off the Antarctic coast last year. Captured, it's a super-heavy breeding machine. "In the past, giant squid have been known to be aggressive and dangerous, which has been feared and misrepresented. But my research shows that they are not marine tyrannosaurs but docile, especially when they mature, They'll be more docile. We're exploring this incredible bizarre phenomenon. As they get older, they get shorter and wider, and slowly, a giant gelatinous blob inside Carrying thousands of eggs. I can't imagine how fast it can shoot jets around it, it's too gelatinous to be an attacking machine at all. It's probably just pregnant with its clutch of eggs The round thing that turns around the seafloor feeds on dead fish, and its mate doesn't take the initiative to hunt." In April this year, a team of scientists thawed and dissected the giant squid, uncovering the mystery of this animal . Scientists were initially stunned by its balloon-sized eyes, which scientists believe are the largest in the animal kingdom. The giant eyes help the squid lock onto prey in dark waters nearly a thousand meters below Antarctic waters. This squid has 2 long tentacles, each with up to 25 rotating hooks; it also has 8 arms, each with 19 hooks for securing and grasping prey, and can catch prey into its mouth. â–¡AFP/Translated by Wang Jinyuan
