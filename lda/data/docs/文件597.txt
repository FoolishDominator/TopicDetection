E-sports female players Of course, there are definitely beautiful figures in the e-sports arena. However, what we want to take stock of here is not the electronic babies, but the female players who are fighting in the arena just like the boys. Their beautiful figures are the most cool and heroic ones on the e-sports arena. NO.1 Cola Speaking of Warcraft, of course, this girl must be mentioned. She is currently the only female e-sports player who is closest to the male player, and has entered the top 8 of the men's competition. She has been in gaming for 8 years now as a web editor. This girl who likes Demon Hunter the most in Warcraft, like many girls, likes to go shopping and read quietly. NO.2 Xu Zhixiu She is the best professional female player of StarCraft in Korea, working hard in the winning and losing world of the game. She is an ordinary Korean girl, and her favorite place is her "little nest". Seo Ji Soo's life doesn't seem as boring as she imagined, and being able to have fun with her family is her happiest place. In her spare time, she likes to listen to music, and sometimes she plays the piano by herself. Although her piano is not as professional as her game, she plays it decently. NO.3 An Jia Is An Jia an e-sports player? Perhaps her most successful identity should be the host of PLU. NO.4 Zhao Meimei
