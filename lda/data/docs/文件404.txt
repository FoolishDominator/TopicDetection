Five Chinese students were arrested in South Korea for defrauding cash. According to the Global Times, South Korean police arrested five Chinese students in South Korea on the 24th who were suspected of defrauding cash through multiple voice calls and handing the stolen money to a habitual criminal. These international students are highly educated, and most of them are forced to commit fraud to make a living. The South Korean police said that the five international students defrauded by voicemail every day, took out the stolen money and handed it over to the chief person in charge of the fraud gang, and the person in charge returned them 200,000 to 300,000 won as a "reward". In this way, from September this year, they handed over an average of 40 million won to the fraud group every day, with a total of more than 1.6 billion won. The police investigation found that the five Chinese students were all master's and doctoral students at a university in Daejeon and North Gyeongsang Province, and most of them committed crimes by actively participating in fraudulent organizations in order to earn living expenses.
