Indonesian "tree man" successfully undergoes surgery (photos) An Indonesian man known as "tree man" has branches and root-like sarcomas on his limbs like tree trunks. A few days ago, he successfully underwent surgery, about 6 kg of sarcoma was removed. According to local media reports, after 9 months of treatment in Bandung, the 35-year-old "tree man" Dede finally successfully got rid of the sarcoma that was so severe that he could not move through 8 operations a few days ago. Dede said he wanted to return to a normal life. The sarcomas on Dede started growing uncontrollably when he was a teenager. The strange disease seriously affected Dede's life, he lost his job, his wife, and his children were living with relatives because he could not take care of him. Unable to act, he can only support himself by performing in the circus. Last year, a dermatologist in the United States confirmed that Dede's strange disease was caused by human papillomavirus. Due to an inborn genetic problem, Dede's immune system has some kind of dysfunction, and the HPV can invade his body and change the mechanism of cell formation, causing a lot of excess material to grow on the skin. Dede's doctor, Rahmat Vinata, said Dede will need to be readmitted in October and undergo at least one operation to remove the remaining about 300 grams of sarcoma.
