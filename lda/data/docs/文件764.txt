Stiglitz: The banking industry problem is more serious than before the crisis Sina Finance News Beijing time on the morning of September 14th, according to foreign media reports, Nobel laureate in economics, Columbia University professor Joseph Stiglitz ( Joseph Stiglitz said a few days ago that after the outbreak of the financial crisis and the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers, the United States has been unable to solve the fundamental problems of the country's banking system. "The too-big-to-fail banks are getting bigger in the U.S. and many other countries," Stiglitz told the media in Paris on Sunday. "The banking problem is even worse than it was before the 2007 financial crisis." "The collapse of Lehman Brothers forced the U.S. Treasury Department to invest huge sums in propping up the country's financial system, Bank of America's assets kept growing, and Citigroup as a whole remained intact. While U.S. President Barack Obama wants to identify some "systemically important" banks for greater regulation, the plan doesn't force them to downsize or simplify their structure. Stiglitz said the U.S. government is cautious about aggressively reforming the financial industry because it is politically difficult. He hopes G20 leaders can get the US to take tougher steps to reform the financial sector. (Xingya) has _COUNT_ comments I want to comment
