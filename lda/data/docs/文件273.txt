Yao Buxian Fire Line: Udine Bo draws SNAI to support Inter Milan to be brave Disk 0.79 tie / hemisphere 1.07, Ladbrokes 0.82 tie / hemisphere 1.02, the water level in the upper disk is lower than the theoretical. The Italian local company SNAI made an initial payout of 2.10/3.10/3.40, and the real-time odds were 2.00/3.20/3.60. The draw odds were already much higher than the average before the adjustment. Now the draw payout of 3.20 is at an absolute high level, which is very suspicious. The bookmaker uses the high payout to block the level. The two sides defeated their opponents in the UEFA Cup in the middle of the week, and they are in good shape, but the visiting team has obvious advantages in the historical confrontation. William, Ladbrokes, Intel and other companies have the highest probability of a draw under the same odds, and Udinese may end with a draw to defeat the visiting team. Recommended: 1. 02. Lecce VS Siena in Europe instantly loses 2.20→/2.89↓/3.46↑, equivalent to the Asian handicap tie/hemisphere high water, the immediate Australian handicap 0.88 tie/hemisphere 0.98, Ladbrokes 0.86 tie/hemisphere 0.98, the upper disk level It is lower than the theory, and the upper plate is slightly optimistic. The Italian local company SNAI adjusted the initial odds from 2.10/3.00/3.50 to 2.15/2.90/3.50. The main winning odds are still lower than the average odds after the increase, while the draw odds and the average odds are basically the same. The Lecce clash record is undefeated at home against the away team. At present, the odds of a away win have risen significantly, and the home team is undefeated by the small radio. Recommended: 31. 03. Turin VS Inter Milan in Europe instantly pays 5.44↑/3.35↑/1.65↓, equivalent to the Asian handicap handicap hemisphere/one ball in water, the immediate Australian handicap 0.98 hemisphere/one ball 0.88, Ladbrokes 0.96 hemisphere/one ball The ball is 0.88, and the water level in the upper plate is still lower than the theory. Inter Milan in the Champions League is in good shape, and Turin is currently in a good state with 1 win and 1 draw. Under such a premise, the current loss of customer wins in Europe is still showing a downward trend, indicating that Inter Milan is more optimistic. Inter's advantage over Turin is too obvious. The Italian local company SNAI adjusted the level of compensation from 3.30 to 3.40, which is a bit higher than the average. In this game, I personally think that Inter Milan, which is strong and in great shape, does not need to defend against the level. Recommended: Bodler 0. 04. Sampdoria VS Chievo Europe instantly loses 1.56→/3.47↑/6.29↑, which is equivalent to the Asian handicap handicap of a goal in the high water, and the immediate Australian handicap is 0.80 hemisphere/one goal 1.06, Ladbrokes 0.76 hemisphere/one goal 1.08, The Asian plate opened shallow. This is not a good sign. Sampdoria has always been known for its excellent home results, while Chievo is a newly-promoted player. There are two possibilities to deal with the Asian handicap. The poor performance of the home team in the league is used to suppress the player's confidence in the upper game. It may be that the dealer is not optimistic about the home team winning. In view of the generally high odds of a draw, it is recommended to take two ends to prevent the cold! Recommended: 30. Combine with Betfair on the spot to see if you go directly to 10. 05. Fiorentina VS Bologna in Europe instantly pays 1.48→/3.66→/7.19↑, which is equivalent to the Asian handicap's main handicap one goal low water, and the instant Australian handicap 0.96 one goal 0.90, Ladbrokes 0.68 hemisphere/one goal 1.16. Handicap water level to see the general situation in Florence. Fiorentina has two matches a week, and their physical strength is at a disadvantage. They are currently winless in the League Cup; Bologna beat Milan 2-1 away. The current opening method of the Asian plate is likely to take into account these factors, and the home team seems to be the consensus to prevent cold! Italian local company SNAI odds 1.40/3.80/8.50, do not take Bologna seriously. In this game, the dealer lured the cold and dared 3!
