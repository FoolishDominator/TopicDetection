Krugman: Center of Destruction Sina Finance News "International Herald Tribune" columnist, Nobel Laureate in Economics Paul Krugman (Paul Krugman) published an article entitled "Center of Destruction" on February 9 Even if US President Barack Obama's original economic stimulus plan is implemented, it will not be enough to fill the loopholes in the US economy, but the self-righteous moderate senators have made the plan softer and worse. Here's a summary of the article: The initial stimulus package included aid to cash-dry states that would quickly boost the economy while guaranteeing basic social services, but moderate senators insisted on cutting the spending by $40 billion. In addition, the initial plan also included school construction spending, unemployment assistance, living allowances for low-income people, etc., but all expenditures have been reduced. Overall, the stimulus package agreed in the Senate "shrunk" by more than $80 billion, and most of the spending cuts fell on those programs that would best ease the recession. Moderates, on the other hand, are apparently satisfied with only one of the worst provisions in the package, a tax break for homebuyers. Dean Baker, co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research, argued that the provision would cost a lot of money and would do nothing to boost the economy. All in all, if the final plan embodies the moderates' insistence on "robbing the poor and helping the rich", it will lead to a significant drop in employment and more suffering. But I think it's all down to President Obama's belief that stimulus packages can transcend partisanship, a belief that distorts his economic strategy.
