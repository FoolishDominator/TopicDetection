American professor brews beer with yeast 45 million years ago "Old style" beer. According to Taiwan's "United Daily News" citing the "Washington Post" report, Kano extracted DNA from an ancient Lebanese weevil trapped in amber as early as 1993. One newspaper described his achievement as enough to overturn many biologists' belief that the DNA of ancient organisms could not be preserved intact. Next, Kano found an ancient bacterium from a bee trapped in amber, hoping to turn this strain into a new antibiotic. Although the experiment was unsuccessful, the doctor of medical mycology was not discouraged. Kano, who is 63 years old and is the director of the Institute of Environmental Biotechnology at Caltech, founded a fossil fuel brewing company with a friend. Using ancient yeasts found in Burmese amber, he successfully brewed a truly ancient beer. And participated in the World Beer Cup in San Diego in April this year. The Auckland Tribune's beer taster Bland said the ancient yeast gave the beer a distinctive "clove flavour" and a peculiar spiciness. Kano said that after sleeping in amber for thousands of years, the yeast was awakened, began to multiply, and was reborn. As such, they are always alive.
