(2009-04-20 20:30:25) Expert [aries Gao] Answer: From a technical point of view, LVS has been effectively supported at the 50 moving average, and the recent trading volume has also increased. It can be held temporarily, but Whether it can climb to the vicinity of the 200-day moving average depends on the broader market and its own performance. (2009-04-20 20:30:25) Netizen [Anonymous] asked: Will Citi raise $4 tonight? (2009-04-20 21:12:04) Expert [aries Gao] Answer: 50 The daily moving average is a good support, and whether it can pass 4 blocks depends on whether the financial stocks as a whole have momentum. However, C fluctuates greatly, so be careful when operating. (2009-04-20 21:12:04) Netizen [anonymous] asked: Teacher Gao. Hello, how is the trend of AIG, thank you (2009-04-20 21:13:51) Expert [aries high] Answer: AIG is a very dangerous stock, it is recommended not to play because it is cheap. If the broader market falls, a pullback to the 50-day moving average is more likely. (2009-04-20 21:13:51) Netizen [anonymous] asked: Teacher aries: I'm glad you came to guide us! Welcome! May I ask, do you think the trend of gold in the past 8 years is really strongly related to the US dollar? Is there a necessary link with inflation? I really feel that it should be decoupled from these two factors. I think that in the year of the financial crisis, gold was organized at 700-1000 US dollars, which is to prepare for higher prices. In fact, it is a special commodity? (2009-04- 20 21:17:37) Expert [aries high] A: There are many factors that affect gold. The relationship between the US dollar and gold is not always negative, but sometimes positive. The U.S. dollar and gold can sometimes be safe-haven investments at the same time. Gold is also a strong commodity. If inflationary pressures increase in the future, then the commodity characteristics of gold will also show. (2009-04-20 21:17:37) Netizen [anonymous] asked: Mr. Gao, hello! I wish you good health and a happy family! Please give pointers: Where is the short-term support and pressure of 601390? Thank you very much! (2009-04-20 21:17:59) Expert [aries Gao] Answer: Thank you, it should be a good choice to sell on rallies at the previous high point of 6.30. The stock has been finishing at the bottom, and there is not much room to fall, but it has risen. The power is also not strong. (2009-04-20 21:17:59) Netizen [Anonymous] asked: Morning! I but c at 4.10, can i sell or buy more! Thanks! (2009-04-20 21:19:11) Expert [aries High] Answer: C fluctuating amplitude is large, the risk is too high, it is recommended not to play. If you must buy, then the 50-day moving average entry level is a good choice. (2009-04-20 21:19:11) Netizen [Anonymous] asked: Hello teacher Gao! You have worked hard! The first time we met, your smile was very kind! Sorry for your trouble. Could you please take a look at the late trend of 600651 and 600179? What price pressure? thank you! (2009-04-20 21:19:23) Expert [aries high] Answer: 600651 is in the ascending channel, and it is now close to the channel trend line resistance of 7.20. It remains bullish in the long term and may follow the direction of the broader market in the short term. The recent resistance at 600179 is the recent high of 7.13, which is bullish in the long term, but it is best to wait for a pullback to enter. (2009-04-20 21:19:23) Netizen [Anonymous] asked: ^^^^!!!!!!!!!Hi, Aries.Bot you and Mr Zeng Wenjun are so handsome. Pls help analyze 000720. Thanks. (2009-04-20 21:24:22) Expert [aries high] Answer: Thank you. Today, 000720 broke through heavy volume, but the daily line failed to break through 4.45 several times, so the pressure on this point is still very strong. (2009-04-20 21:24:22) Netizen [Anonymous] asked: Mr. Arises, hello! Excuse me, the quarterly report issued by BAC today is very good, but the stock price has fallen a lot. Can I buy on dips today, and at what price can I buy it? (2009-04-20 21:34:39) Experts [aries high] Answer: Bank stocks are very unstable now, so the operation is very risky. It is recommended not to take too large positions, or simply not to play. If you must buy, above $7.5, relying on the 50-day moving average is a good choice. (2009-04-20 21:34:39) Netizen [Anonymous] asked: Hello teacher Gao! You have worked hard! The first time we met, your smile was very kind! Sorry for your trouble. Could you please take a look at the late trend of 600651 and 600179? What price pressure? thank you! (2009-04-20 21:38:27) Expert [aries high] Answer: I have already answered it, thank you. (2009-04-20 21:38:27) Netizen [anonymous] asked: Mr. Gao, today the US bank stocks fell, please help to see where the support level of C and BAC is? Will U.S. stocks end their rise next? Would you like more advice? thanks? (2009-04-20 21:44:03) Expert [aries Gao] Answer: C, BAC has answered other people, please take a look. . (2009-04-20 21:44:03) Netizen [anonymous] asked: Mr. Gao, hello! Please analyze the cost of 600895 Zhangjiang Hi-Tech of 14.32 yuan today, how to operate, thank you (2009-04-20 21:57:44) Expert [aries Gao] Answer: 600859 is in the upward channel, but I personally think that the recent rise in the Shanghai Stock Exchange is too high Large, there is a need for adjustment, so it is recommended to hold a small amount of positions, hold cash, and intervene after the callback. The price of 14.32 is OK, there is room for upside. (2009-04-20 21:57:44) Netizen [Anonymous] asked: Teacher Sunshine Handsome: When we first met, did you have any gifts for everyone? I hope you can recommend one or two A-share stocks that you are optimistic about recently or have just broken through, okay? Just say something, let’s communicate and learn from each other, it’s a lot of fun! (2009-04-20 22:02:27) Expert [aries high] A: Please give a personal suggestion, it is too early to conclude that the financial crisis is over. It is very likely that the market will form a head-and-shoulders bottom. I think both the left shoulder and the bottom have been formed, and a pullback is needed to form the right shoulder. So I think it's a good choice to hold cash now and lighten the position. (2009-04-20 22:02:27) Netizen [Anonymous] asked: Handsome guy, I met for the first time, I hope you can give us a good impression of small retail investors. 000825 Taigang Stainless Steel 8.6 cost, how about the market outlook, can hold what. Thank you (2009-04-20 22:05:34) Expert [aries high] Answer: 7-8 block resistance is very strong, 8.6 points should be held for a long time, if it is 5000 points, then it can be held for a long time Yes, because you have enough patience. (2009-04-20 22:05:34) Netizen [anonymous] asked: Mr. Gao, hello! I asked about 600895 Zhangjiang Hi-Tech, not 600859, thank you (2009-04-20 22:05:38) Expert [aries Gao] Answer: I said Zhangjiang Hi-Tech, sorry, I made a typo. (2009-04-20 22:05:38) Netizen [Anonymous] asked: Hello teacher, today the gold futures market in the United States has risen a lot, so the domestic gold stocks that have been adjusted for a long time will be better in the next market. performance. Especially like Shandong Gold. Thank you in advance. (2009-04-20 22:07:14) Expert [aries Gao] Answer: The rising price of gold futures will definitely have a positive effect on gold stocks.
