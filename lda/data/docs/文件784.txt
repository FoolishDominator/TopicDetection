On November 9th, U.S. stock market experts sat in the hall. On November 9th, U.S. stock market expert Zeng Wenjun visited Sina Finance and answered questions about the stock market raised by Sina netizens. Future strategy (I took out two-fifths of the position today, and I regret it. Only 3,000 shares of Zhongjin Gold and 1,000 shares of Shandong Gold were left). This is everyone's problem. Thanks! (2009-11-09 17:56:54) Expert [Zeng Wenjun] A: Since the end of September, we have been optimistic about gold, and gold has indeed gone up without a sustained rise in more than a year. The trend of gold stocks is affected by both stock indexes and gold prices, so it is more complicated, and it is not wrong to make some reductions at this point. Others can continue to hold first. Gold's rally remains strong. (2009-11-09 21:24:13) Anonymous asked: Zeng Shuai: Long time no see! Although I read your articles every day, I still want to ask a few questions here: 1. What is the short-term trend of CITIC Securities? 2. Do Fangda Carbon, Fangda A, and Sichuan Investment Energy all belong to the concept of new energy? What are their short-term trends? ? ? Or ascribed higher and lower? Or hold firmly? ? ? ? ? (2009-11-09 20:35:37) Expert [Zeng Wenjun] Answer: 1. The recent trend of securities stocks can only be said to be flat with the broader market, as is the case with CITIC, so you can refer to my blog's analysis of the broader market for short-term trends. 2. The two Fangda do not know whether the market belongs to them to do new energy, and Sichuan Investment is yes. The leader of new energy is Tianwei and Fengfan. New energy has not yet shown a strong upward momentum, mainly depends on whether crude oil can continue to rise. According to the law this year, whenever the oil price in our country rises, the international oil price will fall. I don't know if this will work or not.

(2009-11-09 21:39:14) Anonymous Q: NTES rebounded well last week, can it continue? Where is the resistance? (2009-11-09 21:07:45) Expert [Zeng Wenjun] A: The current price is the resistance area. The trend of the stock market is still a volatile pattern, which is not strong, so it is still necessary to be vigilant in this area. (2009-11-09 21:42:04) Anonymous asked: Teacher, is there a risk of delisting ETFs, and whether ETFs like UNG will never be delisted. thanks. (2009-11-09 21:15:17) Expert [Zeng Wenjun] Answer: ETFs are also issued by companies. If the share is too low or the company closes, there may be risks of liquidation and settlement. (2009-11-09 21:43:26) A mobile phone user asked: Mr. Zeng! Are you here, reading your blog every day looking forward to pointing 600522 higher chances? 000925 cost 22.41 to chase high and buy, can you still hold it? Thanks! (2009-11-09 21:16:56) Expert [Zeng Wenjun] Answer: 600522 maintains a 45-degree upward trend, which can only be said to be a perfect upward channel. But too perfect always makes people feel guilty, because perfection is mostly artificial, and I don't know when it will break. I generally don't touch stocks with obvious capital manipulation such as 000925, because I can't grasp it, so I can't give you good advice. (2009-11-09 21:55:17) Anonymous Q: Fuqi's report is very strong today, can I still intervene? (2009-11-09 21:20:19) Expert [Zeng Wenjun] A: It is to be expected that the FUQI report is good, and the increase on Friday is not small. 25 is a strong pressure on the stock. Be careful if you get involved. (2009-11-09 21:48:47) Anonymous asked: Hello Mr. Zeng! You are sitting in the hall, there are many people, I hope you can be ranked first. What is the short-term support and pressure level of 600536? Thank you very much! (2009-11-09 21:23:26) Expert [Zeng Wenjun] A: The current price of the stock is the long-term platform in the early stage. Software stocks have been frantically speculated in the past, and the funds involved are unlikely to go out smoothly, and they should take the opportunity to perform. Support at 24, pressure around 28-30. (2009-11-09 21:57:19) Anonymous question: Excuse me, Wen Jun, does the current price of 01919 China COSCO Group around 10 yuan reflect its current fundamentals? Shipping stocks are generally still in the doldrums, and I donâ€™t know if it will improve next year. (2009-11-09 21:27:08) Expert [Zeng Wenjun] A: I think China COSCO's share price does not fully reflect the current status and future of the shipping industry. Sino-Ocean's floating losses on BDI are very ugly, but now that BDI is trending strongly, floating losses will turn into profits. (2009-11-09 22:02:24) Anonymous Q: Is the news about xing convertible bonds negative? (2009-11-09 21:27:09) Expert [Zeng Wenjun] A: Do you mean that the private placement in 2006 was recently completed. It should have already been digested by the market, not to mention positive and negative. (2009-11-09 22:09:55) Anonymous asked: Zeng Shuai: Your statement about oil prices is too effective! ! ! ! I feel like this time will still verify your truth! ! Please take a look at 600016 Minsheng Bank will rise sharply in the short term? Is the issuance of H shares a major benefit? ? ? (2009-11-09 21:40:33) Expert [Zeng Wenjun] A: The oil price this year reflects this law, and we have no way of knowing the reason. It is hard to say when it will change, and it cannot be called the truth. Minsheng Bank's H-share issuance is of course good for the company, and it will not cause expansion pressure on A-shares. But because of this, I don't think there will be a sharp rise in the short term. In addition, Minsheng Bank is still performing relatively well in the stock price of the bank. (2009-11-09 22:16:31) Anonymous asked: Mr. Zeng, hello! You said: "The dollar continues to depreciate, and gold has continued to hit new highs." Are 600547 and 600489 lightening or increasing positions? What are the short-term support and resistance levels? Thank you very much! (2009-11-09 21:46:02) Expert [Zeng Wenjun] Answer: I have analyzed and answered these two stocks before, please refer to it. Friends who have been reading my blog know that my analysis of fundamentals starts in the mid-term. Short-term reference blog's daily analysis of the general trend.

It seems to have fallen again before the market (2009-11-09 21:47:43) Expert [Zeng Wenjun] A: Just look at the process of the investment bank's rating analysis, and don't take the results seriously.

(2009-11-09 21:52:56) Expert [Zeng Wenjun] A: The short-term stock price is at an all-time high of 200 yuan, which is under great pressure. In the long run, Apple faces a lot of competition. The halo of IPHONE is gradually receding, and now may not be the time to buy for a long time.

Do you think that if China buys it, will the price of gold soar? (2009-11-09 21:58:57) Expert [Zeng Wenjun] A: I have not noticed the remarks in this regard, but the price of gold has maintained a strong upward trend. If China really buys on a large scale, maybe the rally will come to an end? (2009-11-09 22:26:09) Anonymous asked: Is the prospect of ctic good? If the existing cost price is 1.5 yuan, is it worth intervening to continue to reduce the cost? (2009-11-09 21:59:49) Expert [Zeng Wenjun] Answer: For biotechnology, it is not recommended to intervene and lower. Because such stocks, if there is good news, it is normal to double several times. If there is no good news, the constant intervention will only go lower and lower. (2009-11-09 22:29:48) Anonymous question: Excuse me, teacher, can I break through with a heavy holding of tens of thousands of shares of Zhongjin Gold? ] Answer: If it is really tens of thousands of shares, it is recommended that you do a band and adjust your positions, which will help maintain a good attitude. (2009-11-09 22:32:07) Anonymous asked: Hello teacher, I finally waited for you to come. May I ask 000933 my cost price is 31.05 yuan. Do you think the coal mining industry is optimistic about the 4th quarter? Thank you for making up (2009-11-09 22:13:01) Expert [Zeng Wenjun] A: First of all, my basic analysis is from a medium-term perspective. Still optimistic about the resource class. Secondly, the trend in recent days has also maintained a relatively cautious attitude. There is something wrong with your intervention point. Hold it for now, but be prepared for possible adjustments. (2009-11-09 22:37:35) Anonymous asked: Teacher: Hello! Can the bac still fall? I want to buy, when is it better to buy, thank you (2009-11-09 22:14:12) Expert [Zeng Wenjun] Answer: The price of intervention is related to your idea of intervention. If you are patient, you can continue to wait. There should be times when the price is lower.

(2009-11-09 22:15:48) Expert [Zeng Wenjun] Answer: UNG9 block The previous low is support, but still not a good time to intervene. At least when the trend goes flat and then consider the issue of gradual long-term intervention.

It stands to reason that they made a lot of money! Why is the stock price so bearish? Mr. Zeng, do you think this is good for coal stocks (2009-11-09 22:17:36) Expert [Zeng Wenjun] Answer: It is indeed good for energy, but the performance of stock prices cannot be simply related.

How much is the right price? Thanks! (2009-11-09 22:34:35) Expert [Zeng Wenjun] A: If you are short-term speculation, you can consider making some closures around 50. This area is the pressure zone. Unless I am very optimistic about the market outlook, or the floating win is huge, I am generally reluctant to place heavy positions near big pressure. (2009-11-09 22:57:41) Anonymous Question: Hello Mr. Zeng, may I ask your opinion on 600008, can it be held for a long time? And that natural gas has lost a lot of money, what should I do? (2009-11-09 22:39:48) Expert [Zeng Wenjun] Answer: 600008 I will not hold him for a long time. However, there has been some recent price hikes in water affairs. If natural gas has lost a lot, I suggest holding it for a long time. Although I have repeatedly suggested not to buy UNG in the past few months, please buy crude oil if you are optimistic about energy. But UNG still has long-term value after all.

(2009-11-09 22:55:13) Expert [Zeng Wenjun] A: It is not recommended to hold the mid-line. Short-term news stimulation will cause the stock price to rise excessively. It is now close to the previous high. Unless you have the same patience as Buffett, it is better to operate in the general direction of technology. (2009-11-09 23:04:38)
