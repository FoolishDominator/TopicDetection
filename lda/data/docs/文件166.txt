The first movie I made, so it's very special and meaningful, thank you all for coming, and thank you for supporting our movie. thanks. Donnie Yen: I hope you all have a very happy Mid-Autumn Festival. Zhang Liangying: I am very honored to sing the title song for "Painted Skin" this time. I also watched the very exciting part in the middle, and I hope "Painted Skin" will be very successful. Zhou Xun: I'm very jealous of you. You've all seen it, we haven't seen it yet. Happy Mid-Autumn Festival, today is the premiere of "Painted Skin", I hope you all have a good time, thank you. Zhao Wei: I am very happy to come to Guangzhou to meet all the media friends and audience. I wish everyone a happy Mid-Autumn Festival. I hope our "Painted Skin" can get everyone's support and love, thank you. Sun Li: Hello everyone, I am very happy to come to Guangzhou to promote "Painted Skin". I have not seen it. I hope you will tell me how the performance is during the group visit. I hope you will like "Painted Skin", thank you. Chen Jiashang thanked Zhang Jingying, host Jingwei, who was moved to tears by watching "Painted Skin" Chen Jiashang: I would like to thank everyone, because after the filming, it was the first time that such a whole team was reunited. Zhang Jingying is also welcome, thank you for singing this for us The main song, because this main song is very important to me, she wrote this song in a very short time, thank her. Anyway, watch the play, I can't say more, I will scold after watching the play. Host: Is the director satisfied with himself? Chen Jiashang: I am quite satisfied. I hope everyone can watch this drama happily. I know that every one of them will be very happy. Host: Director, I watched it, do you want to ask me how I feel? Chen Jiashang: Of course. Host: I was very moved. I cried. I read the original work of "Painted Skin" before, but I think it is completely different. I think it is a very romantic love story. Do you think I am accurate? Chen Jiashang: Completely accurate. Moderator: It is very touching, otherwise everyone will not have expectations. It was here just now, we just finished watching this film and then did the press conference. Many viewers, especially female viewers, cried like me. Chen Kun said that the acting process was very depressing. After watching the movie, the host was very exciting. The host: Except for Chen Kun, Zhang Jingying watched some clips, so no one else has watched it, so what is the feeling of Chen Kun watching it? Chen Kun: I watched this movie on the 10th, and I was quite apprehensive before, because acting with so many good actors is a very happy process, of course with two actresses, and my good friend Sun Li. , and with Donnie Yen, we were in a lot of pain during the process of creating, and we were tortured by the director to the point of going crazy. But after watching the movie, I didn't expect that it could be arranged in such a proportion, and so accurately conveyed the magical vision, perfect sound effects, very bright and gorgeous martial arts, and a poignant love. At that time, the process of acting was actually very depressing, and I also hoped that when it was filmed, it would bring a good feeling to everyone. Chen Kun is happy and Zhao Wei's old classmates play husband and wife and Zhou Xun will cooperate again. There is a surprise host: I know that you are very good friends with Zhou Xun and Zhao Wei. You have cooperated with Zhou Xun many times, but it is the first time to cooperate with Zhao Wei. Talk about what it's been like to work with her. Chen Kun: Zhao Wei is my classmate. This time I play my wife, and Zhou Xun plays the seducer... Moderator: What, she really loves you. Chen Kun: I'm very happy. Zhao Wei is playing my wife. I didn't expect a friend who is slapsticking in private to show the feeling of a husband and wife in front of the camera. I hope the feeling we convey is accurate. I have cooperated with Zhou Xun many times, and it was a great surprise to meet again this time. I also felt and learned a lot. Moderator: One more point. It was the first time I saw you playing on the big screen. You were a heroic general, and you played handsomely, but you were actually very tired, right? Chen Kun: Yes, I also cut some. If I want to talk about fighting, I should say Donnie Yen and Qi Yuwu. Qi Yuwu and Zhou Xun learned more from Donnie Yen to the show host: In the end, how Chen Kun's play is, we can only feel it for ourselves. Mr. Qi Yuwu also hit hard, your tongue is very long? Qi Yuwu: That is to ask others to help, to use special skills. Moderator: The stunts were used very well this time, and you have a lot of stunts. Qi Yuwu: You also have to rely on your own fantasy to act. Moderator: Is your opponent and the beautiful Miss Zhou Xun? Qi Yuwu: There is also Donnie Yen. In fact, it was stressful to shoot before, because he was very experienced, and I didnâ€™t know what would happen, but in the process of cooperation, I was also learning on the side, and I think it was very smooth. Donnie Yen Shows Tie Han's Tenderness, Humor and Wisdom Host: Actually, I tell you, the more powerful you are, the more you feel at ease, because the less you will be hit. Brother Zidan, let's not talk about the fight first, I think you have more tenderness. Donnie Yen: Originally I was a tender person. When I met Director Chen Jiashang, I could give full play to my tender side. Moderator: There is also a humorous side. Donnie Yen: I didn't watch it, I don't know, I hope everyone will not laugh at my bad acting. Moderator: No, the person is very nice. The director commented on the humorous and tender side of Big Brother Dan this time. You discovered this. Chen Jiashang: I have been friends with him for many years. Every time I see him shooting only one side of him, he plays the piano very well. My friend Chen Qingjia invited him to play the piano. I think I will shoot Donnie Yen. , I will definitely give you a comprehensive Donnie Yen. I think the Donnie Yen that everyone saw in "Painted Skin" is the complete one. He is a very good-looking man. Moderator: He is a humorous and intelligent man. Jane Zhang only saw the clip and sang "Painting Heart" with her heart Moderator: Jane Zhang watched the clip, how about it? Zhang Liangying: I am very moved. The part I watched the most touching was the final ending. So when I sang this song, the part I just started singing acapella came from the feeling of this part I watched. . Host: So the song "Painting Heart" is also sung with a moving heart? Zhang Jingying: I understand the same as you, I think this is also a beautiful love story. Zhou Xun plays a simple banshee and denies seducing Chen Kun. Host: I think I should take my boyfriend to watch it together. I educate him, cultivate him, and make him a perfect husband. Today, Zhou Xun came in wearing black. Chen Kun: You should not walk in, but float in (laughs). Zhou Xun: I haven't watched it either. I just dubbed it, but when I dubbed it, I looked at that mouth, when to open it and when to close it. Moderator: I just said that you really love him, you give thumbs up frequently. Zhou Xun: Yes, in fact, she didn't seduce him, Xiaowei didn't seduce Wang Sheng, but really loved him, that's why this is the way, and then there is such a pain at the end. Moderator: When we see the end, we will all think why Zhou Xun is so kind and simple in everything, that is, your eyes are always transparent? Zhou Xun: It was designed by the director. Host: Director, am I right? In fact, you didn't direct it. Her eyes showed such a feeling. Chen Jiashang: It's not complete. In fact, when I talked to Zhou Xun about such a role, I talked about how ordinary people think, how to think about this monster, I said that we don't want what others think, let's get a new one, and I'll take it. I told her what I thought now, and she just thought it was quite fun, so now the demons in "Painted Skin" are different from the so-called demons we shot in the past. Zhao Wei's acting as Xianzhen's wife won unanimous praise from the host: Yes, we don't think there are demons, they are all angels. Next, I'm going to talk about Miss Zhao Wei, she really did a great job. Zhao Wei: Thank you. are you crying? Moderator: I cried. You haven't seen it yourself, but have you ever thought that the audience will cry after watching it?
