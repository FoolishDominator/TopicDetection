On January 22, U.S. stock expert Zeng Wenjun visited Sina Finance and answered questions about stocks raised by Sina netizens. is the most serious answer. Excuse me, if you must play, should you play BAC or C? (2009-01-23 12:59:49) Expert [Zeng Wenjun] A: Since it's just for fun, it doesn't really matter if you don't do it for a long time. The two are similar. Just pay attention to the magnitude and rhythm of the short message stimulus. For example, in the first two days, it was suggested that netizens like to do C's rebound and need to wait until it falls below 3 yuan. After that, when C fell below 3 for the first time, after rebounding from 2.8 to 3.6, it went below 3 yuan again yesterday. If it breaks 3 again, at this time, it will not be easy to bounce back.

(2009-01-23 13:03:26) Expert [Zeng Wenjun] A: qqqq is a Nasdaq ETF. Although technology stocks are not the sector leading the decline, the follow-up impact is gradually deepening. These two days of Sony, Microsoft, and Nokia can all be seen. Everyone is familiar with gs. There are only two of the five major investment banks in the United States that operate independently. Buffett also voted for gs. The United States is still there, and gs is bound to grow bigger and stronger. (2009-01-23 13:03:26) Netizen [Anonymous] asked: Teacher, which of the Chinese concept stocks are you more optimistic about? (2009-01-23 13:05:08) Expert [Zeng Wenjun] A: In the context of the crisis, it is not yet clear which can survive and develop. It takes time to test and discover. For example, in the last wave of Internet stock crisis, NetEase will fall below 1 yuan until it finds a new profit model. Chinese companies in the United States are all market-oriented companies. Judging from the current situation, they are not particularly optimistic, and it will take the test of time and crisis. (2009-01-23 13:05:08) Netizen [Anonymous] asked: Mr. Zeng, I have a question, QID and QLD are double bearish and bullish on QQQQ respectively, why is the range of the day's rise and fall different? the same? (2009-01-23 13:10:01) Expert [Zeng Wenjun] Answer: ETFs are exchange-traded funds, which are also affected by market fluctuations, and may not be completely consistent with the trend of tracking products. So deviations are normal, but the long-term trend is definitely corresponding. (2009-01-23 13:10:01) Netizen [anonymous] asked: Hello teacher! In the afternoon, 600104 Shanghai Auto's intraday trading price jumped up, and it was unlikely to buy. Please click on the stock's trend and prospects for what to pay attention to. I wish the teacher a smooth work in the new year! Thanks! (2009-01-23 19:24:46) Expert [Zeng Wenjun] A: Thank you. The automobile industry is also the focus of the national revitalization policy, but I personally believe that the future of the domestic automobile industry lies in the industrial transfer of developed countries such as the United States. With the deterioration of the economy of developed countries, if the domestic can seize the cost advantage, it is possible to repeat the history of the domestic electromechanical industry and the Japanese automobile industry going global in the 1970s. If you want to start the domestic market now, the current situation is difficult. (2009-01-23 19:24:46) Netizen [Anonymous] asked: Hello, Mr. Zeng! First of all, I wish you an early New Year, and I wish you and your family a happy Spring Festival. Where are the short-term support and pressure levels for 002137? How is it going? Thanks! (2009-01-23 20:58:47) Expert [Zeng Wenjun] A: The support is at 6.5 and the pressure is at 8. Small and medium-sized enterprises should be the most affected in the crisis. However, due to the capital characteristics of the domestic stock market, their short-term performance is often more prominent. Such stocks are firmly out of the market when they are under pressure. (2009-01-23 20:58:47) Netizen [Anonymous] asked: BAC is estimated to be able to enter 5 yuan today, can I make a short-term blog? (2009-01-23 21:27:56) Expert [Zeng Wenjun] Answer: If it is my short-term blog, I will wait for another new low, at least 2 days later. (2009-01-23 21:27:56) Netizen [Anonymous] asked: Hello Mr. Zeng, you didn't answer the question yesterday 600638 Can you intervene now? 03) Expert [Zeng Wenjun] A: It is meaningless to answer now, everything depends on the performance of the external market during the festival. (2009-01-23 21:28:03) Netizen [Anonymous] asked: Excuse me, Mr. Wen Jun, 000762, how is the market outlook urgently your answer cost 13.5 Thank you. (2009-01-23 21:53:37) Expert [Zeng Wenjun] A: I would like to talk about this question, friends who are concerned about the market outlook now, because the US stock market faces an important 8,000 point during the Spring Festival, is it a new round of collapse? The market outlook of A shares will be determined, so we can only look at it after the holiday. (2009-01-23 21:53:37) Netizen [anonymous] asked: Alumni Zeng, hello! ! ! Happy New Year to you! ! ! Glad to see you answering our questions! ! ! Let the alumni look at 600497, the cost of 10.95 has been held for two weeks, and I still haven't earned any money. Can I still go on after the festival? thanks, thanks! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! (2009-01-23 21:53:45) Expert [Zeng Wenjun] Answer: 497's company has been analyzed two days ago. As for the post-holiday market, we need to see the US stock market next week. (2009-01-23 21:53:45) Netizen [Anonymous] asked: The market was down before the market. STP still has a small rise, in the end? (2009-01-23 21:56:57) Expert [Zeng Wenjun] A: Solar stocks and aviation stocks are closely related to oil prices. The independence of individual stocks in U.S. stocks is much stronger than that of A-shares. U.S. stocks are more about the industry, and A-shares are more about the capital situation, which is also a difference between the two places. (2009-01-23 21:56:57) Netizen [Anonymous] asked: Hello teacher: I think the outer market has been down for a long time, after a short-term bottom, there will be a certain rebound, what do you think! Thank you (2009-01-23 21:58:23) Expert [Zeng Wenjun] A: I did an analysis of the Dow yesterday. Financial stocks led the decline first, and technology stocks have emerged in the past two days. Whether it is a new round of storms will soon be known. The company, the economy is definitely deteriorating, whether the stock index can hold 8000, I think it is more difficult. (2009-01-23 21:58:23) Netizen [Anonymous] asked: How about GM, should the cost of 3.8 be enough to ship quickly (2009-01-23 22:03:20) Expert [Zeng Wenjun] A: When talking about GM in December, it said that the rescue plan will definitely pass, just wait for that opportunity to ship, but now the rescue plan of the auto industry has basically come to an end, I don't know if there is still a chance to rise. Even the last wave may already be the time when the industry is really doing well. So I can't make a conclusion for GM yet. Just wait. (2009-01-23 22:03:20)
