Sony is closing its only PlayStation store in the U.S. Apple is expanding its chain, Microsoft is building its own retail store, and Sony is closing its only PlayStation store in the U.S. Just a day after Sony announced that its PSP sales exceeded 50 million units, Sony, due to the need to reduce costs, closed its only PlayStation professional retail store in the United States in the Metreon Shopping Center in San Francisco, and at the Metreon Shopping Center at the same time. Sony Style Living Centers will also be closed (there are many Sony Style Living Centers across the US). This PlayStation professional retail store is also Sony's flagship game store in the United States. It opened in 1999 and covers an area of 350,000 square feet. Every time a new console is released, this is the most lively place and the first place. In normal times, there will always be the latest games on the big screen and in the game bar. The role of this professional retail store is not only sales, but more of a corporate display, a link to maintain consumers. Anyway, it's a pity.
