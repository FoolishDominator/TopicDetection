Both Daqin Railway and Baosteel are stocks that can be held for a long time. But from a short-term point of view, it is now to see the market performance after the holiday. I'm still not optimistic. (2009-09-30 21:45:38) Anonymous asked: Hello, can I buy FAZ now? How risky is FAZ? (2009-09-30 20:56:12) Expert [Zeng Wenjun] Answer: Now it belongs to the situation where the increase is relatively high, and it is facing adjustment pressure. To go short directly, I think it can only be considered as a technical consideration. I said the day before yesterday that I am moderately bearish, and I think it is still inappropriate to go short directly. More consideration is the question of whether to buy after the adjustment. Rather than choosing to go short directly.

Want to enter the market for medium and long term holding.
