(2009-04-13 13:49:35) Expert [Zeng Wenjun] A: The rebound is slightly stronger than expected, but it is still expected, after all, 8000 has not yet broken through. The market outlook needs to see a series of data coming out this week. There are also some friends who have asked about US stocks in the past, and now I don’t recommend it no matter how long or short it is. The market needs to wait for market confirmation. (2009-04-13 13:49:35) Netizen [Anonymous] asked: Breakthrough year? Will Shanghai and Shenzhen A stocks go crazy? ! ! ! (2009-04-13 15:19:22) Expert [Zeng Wenjun] Answer: The momentum of A-shares is very strong today, and it has a lot to do with M2 and new loans. The inflation expectation has caused the inflation of asset prices. It should be said that The rally itself has been insane, and it looks set to continue. Stay awake and engage with caution. (2009-04-13 15:19:22) Netizen [Anonymous] asked: Dear Mr. Zeng Hello! How should BAC and C operate this week? I sold the BAC I bought at $7.68 last Friday for $9.26, should I cover it today? Thank you for your pointers! (2009-04-13 19:33:06) Expert [Zeng Wenjun] Answer: If it has already been sold, I suggest that it is better to wait for a short position. This week's data could cause big swings in an unclear direction. (2009-04-13 19:33:06) Netizen [Anonymous] asked: Mr. Zeng: How about aa and pfe? Which one would be better for buying today? Thanks a lot. (2009-04-13 20:46:29) Expert [Zeng Wenjun] A: If it is a comparison of two stocks, I choose AA, which is also my choice. But if it is said whether to buy today or not, I still have reservations. It is recommended to wait and see. (2009-04-13 20:46:29) Netizen [Anonymous] asked: Ask Mr. Zeng, I bought C at 2.77, can I hold it? What is the target price? Thanks! (2009-04-13 20:59:32) Expert [Zeng Wenjun] Answer: After Citigroup rebounded in 1 block, the 3 block fluctuated greatly. Friday is C's first-quarter earnings report. If it were me, I'd rather be out and wait for clarity. (2009-04-13 20:59:32) Netizen [smile] asked: I recently traded with a broker named SOGOTRADE, and I encountered something: on April 9, I put my own funds in the financing account The purchased BAC was sold, and then I was going to place an order to buy it back at a lower price, but the system prompted "insufficient purchasing power". The number of shares I placed in the buy order was the same as the number of shares I sold. Why is this happening? I hope Teacher Zeng can give pointers! (2009-04-13 21:03:34) Expert [Zeng Wenjun] Answer: It may be related to the fact that the funds in the financing account are not transferred back on the same day. You should contact the broker to confirm. They will give you the most accurate answer. (2009-04-13 21:03:34) Netizen [Anonymous] asked: The handsome teacher Xiao Zeng, although the stock index has broken through the annual line, many people are afraid of plummeting. But I think it is a new beginning, because the treasury bond index has broken and the yield of money funds is very low. The index breaks through the annual line, representing the determination of the big institutions. Do you agree with me? (2009-04-13 21:09:49) Expert [Zeng Wenjun] A: Give a general answer first, and then talk to you about individual stocks. It should be said that the annual breakthrough of the stock index, the main line surrounding resource stocks is still clear, and the hot spots have spread well. Although we are not very optimistic about the long-term economic turnaround, the short-term momentum should continue. As in my comment title, stay half sober and half drunk. On the premise of maintaining a clear understanding, please participate with caution. (2009-04-13 21:09:49) Netizen [Anonymous] asked: Mr. Zeng, is smn expected to reach 30.00? I bought it at this price. Thank you (2009-04-13 21:23:46) Expert [Zeng Wenjun] Answer: I am very embarrassed about this question, because SMN is double shorting raw material stocks. And what I have been most optimistic about since the beginning of the year is raw materials. Maybe there will always be a chance to get to 30. But I am still willing to do more raw materials. (2009-04-13 21:23:46) Netizen [Anonymous] asked: Can Mr. Zeng help me analyze 000729? The broader market has risen a lot, but it has not been moving! (2009-04-13 21:30:27) Expert [Zeng Wenjun] A: I have talked about this type of beverage consumption a few times before. It's not the focus of this market, so it's normal to have no movement. I am optimistic about resources and government-invested industries, while consumer industries are difficult. However, the current stock index is strong, and it can still be held to wait for the opportunity to make up. (2009-04-13 21:30:27) Netizen [Anonymous] asked: Hello newbie, I can't even find the names of US stocks, please recommend free software (not cracked) or websites to have a comprehensive understanding of US stocks, especially gross stocks Thank you (2009-04-13 21:31:43) Expert [Zeng Wenjun] Answer: Your request cannot be satisfied. There is no free good software for US stocks. Just look at Sina for Chinese, and Yahoo for English. (2009-04-13 21:31:43) Netizen [Anonymous] asked: Brother Zeng: Help Pacific 601099. Thanks.

(2009-04-13 21:39:46) Expert [Zeng Wenjun] Answer: You can continue to hold it. The top pressure is 16.5. If it pulls back to 12.5-13, you can consider covering the short positions. The medium and long-term lines are not mentioned now, and the market is purely driven by the flood of liquidity. Don't swipe the screen. : Mr. Zeng, I am looking forward to you! Under your guidance, C, MR, and STP are all empty, but I feel empty. How do you judge these three this week, especially MR and STP, ( 2009-04-13 21:41:05) Expert [Zeng Wenjun] A: For the analysis of individual stocks, you should have read my opinion. There are still quite a few friends who have asked about these stocks. There is no need to feel empty, It is just a process of waiting for an opportunity. I am still cautious, so the US stock market is still the first choice. (2009-04-13 21:41:05) Netizen [Anonymous] asked: Will A shares open lower tomorrow? 600716(2009-04-13 21:46:23) Expert [Zeng Wenjun] Answer: Driven by today's profit disk, if the US stock market closes lower, it may open lower. But this should not be the problem. 600716 has been tossing We cannot give an accurate analysis on the reorganization. After all, it is influenced by news. (2009-04-13 21:46:23) Netizen [anonymous] asked: ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ~~Home, wait for you to see you for a few weeks!!! Help me to see 600357 and 000720, thank you!! ((2009-04-13 21:47:21) Expert [Zeng Wenjun] Answer: Want to buy or sell? I think you can still hold stocks if you have stocks. Those who don’t have stocks can also get involved in leading stocks in various industries. Non-leading stocks can be pulled back to support a moderate amount of buying. (2009-04-13 21:47:21) Netizens [Anonymous] Q: Hello, Mr. Zeng, the US futures gold rose today, and some domestic gold stocks have been adjusted for almost three weeks. Do you think gold stocks are expected to rebound tomorrow under the leadership of gold futures? Thank you for your answer ( 2009-04-13 21:48:23) Expert [Zeng Wenjun] A: The gold stocks have been in a state of consolidation. If the market continues to rise tomorrow, there may be a countermeasure Bomb market. But gold stocks should not be the dominant sector of the market. (2009-04-13 21:48:23) Netizen [Anonymous] asked: Mr. Zeng, why is the US stock market soaring today when you are not optimistic? C has broken through the previous high. (2009-04-13 21:50:09) Expert [Zeng Wenjun] A: Has the US stock market soared? It's down more than 100 points now. Only the performance of C is more prominent. The volatility of individual stocks is very affected, especially low-priced stocks. We are still more concerned about the main contradiction, the dominant factor. (2009-04-13 21:50:09) Netizen [Anonymous] asked: Hello, Mr. Zeng! You have worked hard! It's been a few weeks again, I miss it so much! May I ask the later trend of 600179 blackening, 002077 Dagang and 600143 blonde? Pressure and support? thank you! (I have been asking you for advice since the afternoon, why haven't you answered yet?) (2009-04-13 21:53:43) Expert [Zeng Wenjun] Answer: The first two stocks are very strong, obviously short-term funds operate. Hold it temporarily. In fact, the pressure above is heavy. But the key is that the enthusiasm of the market is too much now, and I don't know how it can continue. The current support pressure is not very important. Walk and watch. (2009-04-13 21:53:43) Netizen [Anonymous] asked: I have cleared all my questions! !!!depressed! ! ! ! ! Hello, brother, I sold the non-ferrous 000060 and bought the 000721 Xi'an tour. The performance of Xi'an tour in the past two days is too meaty. Can you help me to see if I can still hold it? Can I still buy it at the current price of 000060? I thank you in advance! (2009-04-13 22:01:52) Expert [Zeng Wenjun] Answer: At present, the holding problem is not big. Although Xi'an tourism has no achievements, there is no strong theme. But it has always been more active, and maybe suddenly it will show something. So keep it first. Resource classes can still be considered for intervention.

(2009-04-13 22:06:45) Expert [Zeng Wenjun] A: The reason for not rising is because he is a consumer. Now the bullish ones are all resource classes under the background of inflation. But the company has no problem and can hold it.
