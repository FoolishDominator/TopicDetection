Beijing Longfor: The Tongzhou Project Helps Improve Regional Residential Comfort Time: March 16, 2010 14:30 Venue: Sina Leju Jiachao Room, 8th Floor, Ideal International Building Search) Marketing Manager Jiang Dandan Longhu·Huashu Xiangti Marketing Director Yan Long Moderator: Sina Leju Zhang Dandan The following is a wonderful record of the interview: Moderator: All Sina Leju netizens, good afternoon! You are very welcome to pay attention to our guest interview column. Why are we doing this interview today? Because everyone knows that Tongzhou has now become one of our key new cities in Beijing, we Longfor have a new project in Tongzhou this year. . We all know that in 2009, our Huashu Xiangti sold very well. It can be said that it is hard to find a room, which has created a bright spot of the project in the east of Beijing. We invited Ms. Jiang Dandan, the marketing manager of Longfor·Weilan Xiangdai, and Mr. Yan Long, the marketing director of Longfor·Huashu Xiangdai, to talk to us about these two projects. First of all, how do you two view the future development prospects of Tongzhou? The picture shows Yan Longyanlong, Marketing Director of Longhu·Huashu Xiangdai: Recently, there has been a lot of good news in Tongzhou. Both industry insiders and home buyers are very concerned about this area. Because before the "two sessions", the government, especially the Beijing Municipal Government, has shown strong concern for Tongzhou, and has released many positive signals, such as many public transportation lines in the future; in addition, it is to create a window area in Beijing , to build Tongzhou into an international new city. We think Tongzhou will develop very well in the future. We used to call it "the back garden of the CBD". I think Tongzhou's status in the future is not only that, but also better. Jiang Dandan: I think the east is the preferred area for living. For now, this series of favorable development news in Tongzhou may not be realized in the short term, but it brings hope to consumers and is more attractive for them to choose this area. Because the original Tongzhou is also more suitable for living, it is also a preferred area in terms of real estate prices and other aspects. After all, everyone believes in the government's efforts to build and the hope that future development will bring to this region. At present, we can feel at the scene that there should be a qualitative change in this kind of passenger flow this year and last year, including the visiting area of the customer group, which may have been only in the east, but now there are customers from the west and the north. These changes should be the qualitative changes brought after these news. Moderator: I believe that the eastward expansion of the CBD that the government said not long ago will also have a boosting effect on the overall area of Tongzhou. Now our new product is called Huashu Xiangdai. In fact, the previous product of Huashu Xiangdai, "Longhu·Huasheng Xiangdai", is a well-known project in Tongzhou. It can be said that it has a driving effect on the entire real estate circle in Tongzhou. What aspects do you think it is embodied in? Yan Long: The most direct manifestation is the promotion of regional improved residential comfort. For a long time, most of the new properties for sale in Tongzhou are apartment products, and there are relatively few low-density communities. In this regard, Longfor has 15 years of accumulation, and has always been creating low-density products, which is more professional in this field. Longfor brought the accumulation of these 15 years to Tongzhou and the eastern customer base. Moderator: I think your summary is also concise. Just now, Manager Jiang talked about the changes in customers of Weilan Xiangdai. Weilan Xiangdai should also be a project that everyone pays more attention to. At least for a few months, I have seen that our Sina Leju netizens have been constantly looking forward to it. What more features does this new disc bring us? The picture shows Jiang Dandan, marketing manager of Longhu·Weilan Xiangti. Jiang Dandan: Whether it is a villa in Tongzhou or other areas, most of the characteristics are that there is a relatively lack of living facilities, including some relatively mature villa areas and some high-end apartments in the east. The community, too, will have this ease of transportation and future education and dining. Now our Weilan Xiangti brings you a convenient life circle within a 10-minute walk, and we can reach Carrefour within a 5-minute walk. So this kind of convenience should be a qualitative change for low-density customers. Why do you say that? Many customers want to live in such low-density communities, but some customers have been slow to choose, that is, they cannot do without the convenience of urban communities. There will be primary and secondary schools next to our community, including Carrefour just mentioned. This kind of convenience does not bring him a single change. This kind of low-density product is difficult to achieve. The project can not only enjoy the comfort of this life, but also the convenience of the city, and this product is also very scarce in the current market. Moderator: As you said, I believe that the infatuation of many of our netizens is worth it. Just now Dandan also talked about a major display of our Weilan Xiangdai on the product. What kind of product upgrades will Huashu Xiangti have on products this year? Yan Long: I think the upgrade of Huashu Xiangdai can be viewed from two dimensions. First, is the location. Longfor's previous villa projects in Beijing also rely on this traditional villa area, and cooperate with the surrounding superior natural environment to create high-quality and comfortable holiday villas. As the first project of Longhu to enter the villa market in eastern Beijing, Huashu Xiangti is a new attempt for convenient urban villas. The second is the product. First of all, Longfor has always insisted on the creation of product comfort, including its garden landscape, including its property services, including the separation of people and vehicles. In addition, Huashu Xiangti has also done a lot of optimization in the layout. For example, our stacked villas have a very good layout. The width is generally about 10 meters, the depth is relatively short, and the single-story area is 130 square meters. Left and right, space utilization and sense of scale have advantages over many townhouses and even single-family products. In addition, for villas, it is not a matter of being large in size, but more importantly, the design of the interesting space should be reasonable. For example, the stacked villa of Huashu Xiangdai, as the underground part of the fun space, has a large scale of 140 square meters, and has been fully sunk in the front and back, so the lighting and permeability are comparable to the first floor. In addition, we use Centralized floor heating can be described as warm in winter and cool in summer. In such a space, we can realize the beautiful vision of life. Jiang Dandan: Because the traditional basement is mainly light, it can meet the temporary use. However, the basement in Beijing will become damp for a certain period of time. The underground space in Longfor Villa will not only bring comfort to the owner, but also provide ventilation and natural lighting to meet the needs of life. We want every inch of space we create for our customers to be comfortable. This can further highlight the real comfort that Longfor brings to you in the creation of products. Host: As far as I know, Weilan Xiangti is a type of apartment with a strong sense of villa. What is its specific concept? Jiang Dandan: Because from the perspective of Longfor's current products, we hope that more customers will feel our products and experience our products. Our different projects may be aimed at different customer groups from the early stage. In terms of area, the total area of single-family villas of Weilan Xiangti is between 230 and 270. In terms of use, such a small space can be satisfied by three generations of young and old. This kind of comparison is suitable for some customers who have apartments in urban areas. In terms of unit type, the living room and dining room on the first floor of Weilan Villa. The master bedroom on the second floor contains a more luxurious cloakroom, which is about 60 square meters. In general, such a space is only available in a flat-floor apartment of four or five hundred. In addition, there is an upper stacking space, which can be used both as a family space and as your own study. Moderator: It can be said that we have demonstrated Longfor's quality-first mentality in terms of apartment types, parking spaces, and gardens. Just now, both of them mentioned the situation of urban villas around the CBD. We have repeatedly compared the two to prove that there is a certain comparability between the two products. Many people do have such a situation. I have so much money. Should I go to the second ring and the third ring to buy a luxury house, or go to Tongzhou to buy a cost-effective mansion with a very good living experience. How do the two of you view this issue, and what advantages do you think our product has compared to luxury houses on the edge of the city? Jiang Dandan: In fact, in our communication with customers, we can find that some customers are ignored, that is, customers who will ignore space upgrades. Now many people in this age group in their 30s and 40s, they have the elderly and children, so there are very few products provided to them. In terms of area demand, in this area of Tongzhou, there are currently some projects on the edge of the Fourth Ring Road or the Third Ring Road. There may not be such suitable projects. Judging from the development of Tongzhou, the convenience of life can be close to that of some areas in the east. Yan Long: Even compared with luxury houses near the core of the city, Huashu Xiangti's residential comfort is completely competitive. What is rare is that our price advantage is also obvious. The key is the price of the stacked villas in Weilan Xiangdai or Huashu Xiangdai. Currently, only three-bedroom units of more than 100 square meters can be bought in the second ring, the third ring, or even the fourth ring. At present, these areas can be called luxury houses, and the total price is not less than ten million. Another point Dandan also mentioned is that there is a good expectation for convenience now. The extension line of Liangguang Road is very close to us, and the straight-line distance is about 1.1 kilometers. In addition to the two expressways of Jingtong and Beijing-Shenzhen, there will be three main lines between the urban area and Tongzhou in the future. In addition to the planning for multi-line rail transit, the future traffic convenience of Tongzhou is also evident. In addition, Longfor not only pays attention to the creation of the product itself, but also cares about the owner's feeling after moving in. Longfor's property services are very user-friendly, so I won't go into details here. Jiang Dandan: In the process of communicating with customers, a large number of customers not only pay attention to products, but also pay more attention to property services and the environment of the community. It is precisely these two points that we have done well in Longfor. Yan Long: I believe that many successful people have this kind of dream, that is, to bring their own baby, bring their own elderly, bathe in the sun on weekends, and drink coffee in the courtyard of their own homes. Everyone has such a dream, but in a relatively crowded city like Beijing, this kind of dream is very difficult to achieve. In Huashu Xiangti, this dream can be realized in the future. i want to comment
