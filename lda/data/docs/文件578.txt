The Korean StarCraft project once again swept the top three in the world. In the just-concluded competition for the third and fourth place in the StarCraft project, bisu was not affected by the previous defeat against jaedong, and easily defeated the 14-year-old German teenager Kolllsen with a score of 2:0. . Bisu has undoubtedly become the world's third place in the WCG2009 interstellar project, and the interstellar finals will be launched between jaedong and stork, and the Korean interstellar project once again swept the world's top three. In the first game, bisu chose to start with two mines, and kolllsen chose to start with three mines. After the first attack was upgraded, a wave of Bisu troops launched strongly, easily tearing through the defense line made by Kolllsen's ground thorns. Kolllsen sent flying dragons again to try to knock out the lightning in Bisu's mixed army, but Bisu didn't give him any chance. Kolllsen's flying dragon was completely wiped out by Bisu's lightning. At this time, kolllsen was powerless to resist, and had no choice but to play GG. In the second game, Bisu chose the double-barracks rush, because Kolllsen filled two bunkers at his sub-base and used a small amount of puppies to help defend, so Bisu did not take too much advantage. After the second mine was opened, a wave of Bisu's speed-up fanatics suppressed the entrance of Kolllsen's base, and Kolllsen barely defended Bisu's attack. At this time, the speed-up puppy of Kolllsen wandering outside rushed to the main base of Bisu in a situation of changing homes. When he reached the gate of Bisu base, he hesitated and chose to return to defense, and Kolllsen also missed the only chance to defeat Bisu. After opening the third mine, a wave of bisu mixed troops made the German teenager stop in the top three in the world
